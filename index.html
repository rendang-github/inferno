            <h2>Character Creation</h2>
            <div class="stylecap"><span>T</span></div>his campaign is based on the core D&amp;D 5E rule set, however the multiverse is a strange place with a variety of magical and psychic effects which may afflict or assist the characters.

            <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>
            Characters are created according to the point buy system.  Characters start with <strong>38</strong> points.  Points can be spent improving ability scores, but the cost to improve a statistic increases substantially the higher it gets.  See table below.  Ability scores can also be reduced, giving players a small amount of additional character points to boost other statistics.
            </p>

            <p>
            A 1st level character may have a maximum ability score of 18 for any given statistic, inclusive of racial bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each time a character gains an additional level, an additional ability score point is gained.  This is in addition to any ability score improvement granted by the character's class progression and/or feats.  Unspent ability score points may be saved for use at a later time. 
            </p>


            <h5>Ability Score Cost</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2 tcenter3">
                <tr><th>Ability Score</th><th>Initial cost</th><th>Improvement Cost</th></tr>
                <tr><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>n/a</td></tr>
                <tr><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>4</td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>

                <tr><td>5</td><td>-4</td><td>2</td></tr>
            </table>

            The <em>initial cost</em> represents the character point cost to buy the statistic at character creation time.  The <em>improvement cost</em> is the number of points required to raise the ability score from it's current value to the next highest value.

            <div class="flavour">
                <strong>Grognak the Barbarian</strong> cares only for STR, CON, and DEX, so his player selects a starting score of 5 for WIS, INT, and CHA, giving him more character points to spend on his "important" ability scores, selecting 18 for STR and CON, and 16 for DEX.  The cost of Grognak's STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, and CHA add up to 19 + 19 + 12 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 38.<br/>Unfortunately Grognak was not smart, cunning, or well liked and later died after mistaking a large stone for a potato.  Had Grognak lasted until 3rd level he could have used those additional character points to improve his INT, WIS or CHA from a 5 to a 6, perhaps granting him the knowledge that the rock was not a potato, the common sense to not eat things you find on the ground, or the personality that would motivate people to assist him rather than point and laugh as he choked to an entirely avoidable death.
            </div>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            Alignment is real and has actual in-game consequences.  There are no innate disadvantages to any particular alignment, however managing your relationship with the other party members will be important.  You can be disagreeable, but working together will generally be in your best interests.
            <div class="img98"><img class="inline98" src="img/paladin_mask.png"></div>
            Furthermore, there are many places in the world where one might argue that a civilization or a place is predominantly good, or evil, lawful or chaotic.  Yet most of the time it is not the place itself that has an alignment, but the people and creatures that populate it.  In the outer planes this is not true.  The entire plane has an alignment, and is fundamentally good, or profanely evil.  The land and space within this plane might enforce a rules based order, or perhaps even preclude one!  This has a real in-game effect on the players and may be a boon or a bane.

            <h5>Plane Alignment Boon</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2 tcenter3">
                <tr><th>Player Alignment</th><th>Plane Alignment</th><th>Alignment Boon</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Lawful</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Chaotic</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Lawful</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Chaotic</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Evil</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Good</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Evil</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Neutral</td><td><em>Any</em></td><td>0</td></tr>
            </table>

            These values are cumulative.  For example, a <strong>Lawful Good</strong> character in a <strong>Lawful Good</strong> plane will have a boon of +2.  A <strong>Lawful Good</strong> character in a <strong>Chaotic Neutral</strong> plane will have a boon of -1.  <strong>True Neutral</strong> characters never receive a boon or a penalty.

            <h5>Boons and Curses</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2">
                <tr><th>Alignment Boon</th><th>Effect Magnitude</th></tr>

                <tr><td>+1</td><td>+1 bonus</td></tr>

                <tr><td>-2</td><td>-1d4 penalty</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h5>Character Level</h5>
            As characters progress and their personal beliefs become stronger, so too do the effects.  Effects at higher character levels must apply additional effects.

            <h2>Madness</h2>

            <div class="img97"><img class="inline97" src="img/insanity.png"></div>
            The multiverse contains many places and situations that challenge the characters understanding of the true nature of reality.  Observing and being subjected to unspeakable horrors can cause one to lose ones mind.  Conversely, characters that can hold it together under difficult circumstances can gain a better understanding of reality.  We call this grasp of reality sanity, and this is represented in game as a sanity value.  Similar to hit points, losing your sanity means losing you mind and your life.  Unlike hit points, sanity points are not an all or nothing proposition.  You can be at 1 hit point and be just as effective as someone at full hit points, however losing sanity points has in-game effects, as does gaining sanity.


            <h3>Sanity Points</h3>

            Each character starts with <strong>10</strong> sanity points.  Sanity points may be gained and lost during the course of the campaign.  Lose too many and your character's mental state may be brought to the point where they are no longer functional beings, the mortal equivalent of death.

            <h5>Sanity Point Effects</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tleft2 tleft3">
                <tr><th>Points</th><th>Title</th><th>Effects</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>Lost</td><td>Permanent mental breakdown.  Roll a new character</td></tr>

                <tr><td>4</td><td>Demented</td><td>Disadvantage on skill checks.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>Certifiable</td><td>-1 to saves and skill checks.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>8</td><td>Disturbed</td><td>Insanity table roll for affliction.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>Uncertain</td><td><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td><td>Clear of mind</td><td>Not afflicted</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td><td>Free thinker</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td>Mental Adept</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>18</td><td>Mind Master</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>20</td><td>Enlightened</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Sanity Checks</h3>
            A character's ability to resist madness is based on their deepest, innermost, personal source of inner strength.  For a warrior, this would be their usefulness in combat.  For a wizard, this would be their intellect.  For a bard person, this would be their ability to entertain.  A sanity check comprises of an ability score check on the prime requisite of their character class.  As prime requisite ability scores for character classes are ambiguous in D&amp;D 5th Edition, a player may choose either of the saving throw proficiency ability scores for their 1st level class.  Once chosen, this prime requisite for the purpose of making sanity checks is immutable for the remainder of the campaign.  For example, a player creating a Fighter may choose either <strong>STR</strong> or <strong>CON</strong> as their prime requisite.  A Cleric may choose <strong>WIS</strong> or <strong>CHA</strong>, etc.  However, once chosen it cannot be changed later.

            <p>
            The DM may require one or more characters to make a sanity check.  The player should roll a 1d20, add their Proficiency Bonus, and the Ability Score  modifier for their prime requisite.  If the total is greater than or equal to the check DC, the character passes.  If the character fails, they will lose one sanity point.
            </p>

            <h3>Regaining Sanity</h3>
            
            Lost sanity points can be recovered via a number of means, including:

            <h4>Inspirational (or Dirty) Deeds</h4>
            A character performing a exceptional deed strongly oriented toward their alignment.  Such deeds should be of a creative and uncommon variety, and would typically involve some substantial cost or risk to the character.  Successful completion of the deed helps the character reaffirm their self worth and ego, enabling them to regain some amount of control over their mental state.

            <h4>Inspiration Points</h4>
            A character can gain a sanity point by expending their Inspiration.  This only applys to DM awarded Inspiration and not other character derived forms.

            <h3>Affliction types</h3>

            Upon dropping to a sufficient sanity level to aquire an affliction, the player should roll 1d20 to determine what the affliction is.  Players are expected to role play the affliction appropriately, starting with mild symptoms, and getting progressively worse as their sanity decreases.

            <table class="green tright1 tleft2">
                <tr><th>d20</th><th>Afflication</th></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Dipsomania</strong> - the compulsion to drink alcohol</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Kleptomania</strong> - the compulsion to steal</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Schizoid</strong> - loss of personality</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Pathological liar</strong> - compulsion to lie</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Monomania</strong> - singular obsession</td></tr>

                <tr><td>15</td><td><strong>Hallucinatory Insanity</strong> - afflicted sees or hears things which do not exist</td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td><strong>Sado Masochism</strong> - the individual may have swings between two different conditions. at one extreme they wish to inflict pain on others. At the other extreme they wish to suffer pain</td></tr>

                <tr><td>20</td><td><strong>Catatonia</strong> - abnormal movements and behaviors, immobility, and withdrawal</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Curing Afflictions</h3>

            <p>
            The only way to permanently cure an affliction is to raise your sanity points back above the level at which the affliction was obtained.  If the character's points drop below that level again, a new affliction is acquired and the player must re-roll on the affliction table.
            </p>
            <p>
            Players may use magical healing to temporarily raise their sanity points back to at most a value of 10.  Example spells which may help with this include <em>Calm Emotions</em>, <em>Lesser Restoration</em>, <em>Greater Restoration</em>, and <em>Heal</em>.

            <h2>Death</h2>
            The characters are bound into the service of the infernal plane.  As such, when reduced to zero hit points, the character does not fall unconcious, but is transported back to the Nine Hells.  This is an extremely traumatic and jarring experience to a character's psyche, and as such there are consequences to this.  A character "killed" in this manner must make a sanity check or lose a sanity point upon returning to Hell.
            <p>
            After having returned to Hell, the character may choose to wait for the other party members to return, or seek a way to rejoin the party based on the circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3>Resisting Death</h3>
            The player may choose to resist returning after being reduced to zero hit points.  For each round the player must make a sanity check.  On a successful check, the character remains as a <strong>Vengeful Spirit</strong> that can still participate in an unresolved conflict.  On a failed sanity check, the character will return to Hell as above, but will suffer an additional sanity point loss.
            <p>
            The stats and powers of the <strong>Vengeful Spirit</strong> will depend on the character's alignment, and will be revealed upon this condition occurring.

            <h2>Character Race</h2>

            <p>
            Most campaigns take place on the prime material plane, where there is a fantastic multitude of available player races to play from the now standard elves, dwarves, and hobbits and other staples of classic fantasy fiction, to exotic minotaurs, lizard men, and demonspawn.  Yet this pales in comparison to the mind bending variety of possible player character races on the planes such as Genasi, Gith, Formians, and many more.  In this campaign, players will be able to create characters from any reasonable race, and maybe just some unreasonable ones!  Players can work with the DM to create a novel race around a particular idea to provide a memorable but balanced playable race concept.  The only type of being off-limits are those native to the Nine Hells.  Note that this does not include Tieflings, as they are native to the prime material plane.

            <h2>Monsters</h2>
            As the campaign progresses, the player characters will encounter exotic never before seen creatures.  Many of these creatures may be benign or even beneficial, most will be hostile, and some will test the very limits of the characters psyche.

            Significant monster categories will be documented here for reference, revealed after being encountered.

            <h2>Magic Items</h2>
            Magic pervades the very essence of the planes.  Very often magic is captured into a physical form, perhaps by a deranged wizard for later use to gain an advantage over enemies or to achieve a greater goal, perhaps as a failed experiment tested and then later discarded by a lost and forgotten god, perhaps even formed naturally via a rare confluence of the elements and forces of the universe.  In any case, magic items add great power to the player characters, and are prolific throughout the planes.  The biggest question is where to find them, and how to liberate them from their owners without getting killed in the process...

            Significant magical items will be documented here for reference, revealed after being encountered.

            I have learned much in my time here,<br/>
            The ways of the monk, to harness my mind and body,<br/>
            But I cannot shake the feeling that there is more,<br/>
            More to my people, more to my purpose.<br/>
            <br/>
            <em>(Enter a messenger)</em><br/>

            My lord, there is news from the council,<br/>
            The elders of the cult of Null,<br/>
            They plan to resurrect their dragon god,<br/>

            Hear my words and understand,<br/>
            The cult of Null plots treachery,<br/>
            They would sacrifice our kin to their dragon god.<br/>

            <strong>Zaerith:</strong><br/>

            My friend, I have learned much here,<br/>

            <h3>Feuriel (Jason Pancoast)</h3>
            <h4>The Fallen Angel</h4>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/Feuriel.png"></div>
            <p>
            She remembers nothing of her angelic existence, apart from the feeling of boundless joy and eternal peace in all things. And she remembers the following:
            </p>
            <p>
            The archangel Xandriel stood before her, surrounded by choirs and hosts of angels. He continued speaking,”...thou shalt hereafter be called Feuriel, and thou art hereby cast from Heaven---”
            </p>
            <p>
            At the instant the last syllable was uttered, the pain began, and it never stopped. Joy and peace were ripped from her, and physical pain accompanied it. She felt a vertigo, as if she was falling, though she could see nothing but blinding white light, which hurt also.
            </p>
            <p>
            She felt the pain of death, 666 times, as she passed through the mortal world repeatedly, still blinded but seeing only a dismal shade of gray. She felt again and again the futile agony of humanity. She remembers thinking, “So this is why they are as they are.”
            </p>
            <p>
            This was just the beginning of her journey, for the meaningless gray began to deepen into an ominous darkness. Deeper and deeper she fell, the trauma increasing. She felt her body burning, her wings being seared off, only to be reformed and destroyed again. Over and over, deeper and deeper, into the eternal suffering that is Hell.
            </p>
            <p>
            As an immortal being, she does not perceive time, so it can’t be said how long the fall lasted. But it had a beginning, and an end. The end, is in pure darkness, tangible evil.
            </p>
            <p>
            She can feel herself surrounded by beings of palpable hatred. Like a cornered animal, she brandishes her sword and presents her shield, which she still clutches, against the darkness. Terrified, but not afraid, Feuriel calls out to them, “Do unto me what you will! You cannot know the suffering I have already endured. Whatever you have for me, tis but a drop in the ocean, compared to what I have lost, where I have been. You will never know...”
            </p>
            <p>
            Her sight starts to return. She wishes it hadn’t.
            </p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Feuriel, or “Fury” as she can be called, is a being of contradictions. A stalwart of Heaven, in the service of Hell, she is both beautiful and grotesque. Her pale flawless skin is in places split open, exposing blackened flesh and silvery bones. Her alluring shape is interrupted by gaping sinews where her form is not whole. One eye continuously weeps blood. Her long, unkempt, jet-black hair frames intoxicating, unwavering eyes which change color to match her mood. From her delicate shoulders sprout the useless remnants of mighty wings, charred and broken.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel’s demeanor is similarly contradictory. She is both confident and scared, powerful and frail. She distrusts everyone yet will ally with anyone. The only person she fully trusts is herself, and that is the person most likely to deceive her. She clings to a moral code, keeping her word above all else, and keeping her suffering within, except to inflict suffering on those who deserve it through their choices and actions. She believes she is superior to others, yet she feels inferior. She peers intently at a world she tries not to see, lost while knowing her place, in a realm completely foreign yet strangely familiar. Her self-control dances with anger; hope oscillates with despair. Her faith is being tested and she doesn’t know if she wants it to prevail or not.
            Feuriel is a paladin of Torm, the lawful good god of duty, loyalty, and obedience. She serves him still, though she is unsure how. She wields an ornate longsword and a brilliant bronze shield whose insignia has been melted beyond recognition. Her lithe body is draped with scraps of white clothing and fragmented armor.
