            <h2>Character Creation</h2>
            <div class="stylecap"><span>T</span></div>his campaign is based on the core D&amp;D 5E rule set, however the multiverse is a strange place with a variety of magical and psychic effects which may afflict or assist the characters.

            <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>
            Characters are created according to the point buy system.  Characters start with <strong>38</strong> points.  Points can be spent improving ability scores, but the cost to improve a statistic increases substantially the higher it gets.  See table below.  Ability scores can also be reduced, giving players a small amount of additional character points to boost other statistics.
            </p>

            <p>
            Race and feat based ability score bonuses apply *after* the point buy, and as such are "free" as far as points are concerned.  However, a 1st level character may have a maximum ability score of 18 for any given statistic, inclusive of racial bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each time a character gains an additional level, an additional ability score point is gained.  This is in addition to any ability score improvement granted by the character's class progression and/or feats.  Unspent ability score points may be saved for use at a later time.
            </p>


            <h5>Ability Score Cost</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2 tcenter3">
                <tr><th>Ability Score</th><th>Initial cost</th><th>Improvement Cost</th></tr>
                <tr><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>n/a</td></tr>
                <tr><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>4</td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>-2</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>-4</td><td>2</td></tr>
            </table>

            The <em>initial cost</em> represents the character point cost to buy the statistic at character creation time.  The <em>improvement cost</em> is the number of points required to raise the ability score from it's current value to the next highest value.  The improvement cost is calculated based on the value of the ability score without the racial or feat bonuses applied.

            <div class="flavour">
                <strong>Grognak the Barbarian</strong> cares only for STR, CON, and DEX, so his player selects a starting score of 5 for WIS, INT, and CHA, giving him more character points to spend on his "important" ability scores, selecting 18 for STR and CON, and 16 for DEX.  The cost of Grognak's STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, and CHA add up to 19 + 19 + 12 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 38.<br/>Unfortunately Grognak was not smart, cunning, or well liked and later died after mistaking a large stone for a potato.  Had Grognak lasted until 3rd level he could have used those additional character points to improve his INT, WIS or CHA from a 5 to a 6, perhaps granting him the knowledge that the rock was not a potato, the common sense to not eat things you find on the ground, or the personality that would motivate people to assist him rather than point and laugh as he choked to an entirely avoidable death.
            </div>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            Alignment is real and has actual in-game consequences.  There are no innate disadvantages to any particular alignment, however managing your relationship with the other party members will be important.  You can be disagreeable, but working together will generally be in your best interests.
            <div class="img98"><img class="inline98" src="img/paladin_mask.png"></div>
            Furthermore, there are many places in the world where one might argue that a civilization or a place is predominantly good, or evil, lawful or chaotic.  Yet most of the time it is not the place itself that has an alignment, but the people and creatures that populate it.  In the outer planes this is not true.  The entire plane has an alignment, and is fundamentally good, or profanely evil.  The land and space within this plane might enforce a rules based order, or perhaps even preclude one!  This has a real in-game effect on the players and may be a boon or a bane.

            <h5>Plane Alignment Boon</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2 tcenter3">
                <tr><th>Player Alignment</th><th>Plane Alignment</th><th>Alignment Boon</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Lawful</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Chaotic</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Lawful</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Chaotic</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Evil</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Good</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Evil</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Neutral</td><td><em>Any</em></td><td>0</td></tr>
            </table>

            These values are cumulative.  For example, a <strong>Lawful Good</strong> character in a <strong>Lawful Good</strong> plane will have a boon of +2.  A <strong>Lawful Good</strong> character in a <strong>Chaotic Neutral</strong> plane will have a boon of -1.  <strong>True Neutral</strong> characters never receive a boon or a penalty.

            <h5>Boons and Curses</h5>

                <tr><th>Alignment Boon</th><th>Effect Magnitude</th></tr>

            <h5>Character Level</h5>
            As characters progress and their personal beliefs become stronger, so too do the effects.  Effects at higher character levels must apply additional effects.

            <h2>Madness</h2>

            <div class="img97"><img class="inline97" src="img/insanity.png"></div>
            The multiverse contains many places and situations that challenge the characters understanding of the true nature of reality.  Observing and being subjected to unspeakable horrors can cause one to lose ones mind.  Conversely, characters that can hold it together under difficult circumstances can gain a better understanding of reality.  We call this grasp of reality sanity, and this is represented in game as a sanity value.  Similar to hit points, losing your sanity means losing you mind and your life.  Unlike hit points, sanity points are not an all or nothing proposition.  You can be at 1 hit point and be just as effective as someone at full hit points, however losing sanity points has in-game effects, as does gaining sanity.


            <h3>Sanity Points</h3>

            Each character starts with <strong>10</strong> sanity points.  Sanity points may be gained and lost during the course of the campaign.  Lose too many and your character's mental state may be brought to the point where they are no longer functional beings, the mortal equivalent of death.

            <h5>Sanity Point Effects</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tleft2 tleft3">
                <tr><th>Points</th><th>Title</th><th>Effects</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>Lost</td><td>Permanent mental breakdown.  Roll a new character</td></tr>

                <tr><td>4</td><td>Demented</td><td>Disadvantage on skill checks.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>Certifiable</td><td>-1 to saves and skill checks.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>8</td><td>Disturbed</td><td>Insanity table roll for affliction.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>Uncertain</td><td><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td><td>Clear of mind</td><td>Not afflicted</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td><td>Free thinker</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td>Mental Adept</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>18</td><td>Mind Master</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>20</td><td>Enlightened</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Sanity Checks</h3>
            A character's ability to resist madness is based on their deepest, innermost, personal source of inner strength.  For a warrior, this would be their usefulness in combat.  For a wizard, this would be their intellect.  For a bard person, this would be their ability to entertain.  A sanity check comprises of an ability score check on the prime requisite of their character class.  As prime requisite ability scores for character classes are ambiguous in D&amp;D 5th Edition, a player may choose either of the saving throw proficiency ability scores for their 1st level class.  Once chosen, this prime requisite for the purpose of making sanity checks is immutable for the remainder of the campaign.  For example, a player creating a Fighter may choose either <strong>STR</strong> or <strong>CON</strong> as their prime requisite.  A Cleric may choose <strong>WIS</strong> or <strong>CHA</strong>, etc.  However, once chosen it cannot be changed later.

            <p>
            The DM may require one or more characters to make a sanity check.  The player should roll a 1d20, add their Proficiency Bonus, and the Ability Score  modifier for their prime requisite.  If the total is greater than or equal to the check DC, the character passes.  If the character fails, they will lose one sanity point.
            </p>

            <h3>Regaining Sanity</h3>

            Lost sanity points can be recovered via a number of means, including:

            <h4>Inspirational (or Dirty) Deeds</h4>
            A character performing a exceptional deed strongly oriented toward their alignment.  Such deeds should be of a creative and uncommon variety, and would typically involve some substantial cost or risk to the character.  Successful completion of the deed helps the character reaffirm their self worth and ego, enabling them to regain some amount of control over their mental state.

            <h4>Inspiration Points</h4>
            A character can gain a sanity point by expending their Inspiration.  This only applys to DM awarded Inspiration and not other character derived forms.

            <h3>Affliction types</h3>

            Upon dropping to a sufficient sanity level to aquire an affliction, the player should roll 1d20 to determine what the affliction is.  Players are expected to role play the affliction appropriately, starting with mild symptoms, and getting progressively worse as their sanity decreases.

            <h3>Curing Afflictions</h3>

            <p>
            The only way to permanently cure an affliction is to raise your sanity points back above the level at which the affliction was obtained.  If the character's points drop below that level again, a new affliction is acquired and the player must re-roll on the affliction table.
            </p>
            <p>
            Players may use magical healing to temporarily raise their sanity points back to at most a value of 10.  Example spells which may help with this include <em>Calm Emotions</em>, <em>Lesser Restoration</em>, <em>Greater Restoration</em>, and <em>Heal</em>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <h2>Death</h2>
            The characters are bound into the service of the infernal plane.  As such, when reduced to zero hit points, the character does not fall unconcious, but is transported back to the Nine Hells.  This is an extremely traumatic and jarring experience to a character's psyche, and as such there are consequences to this.  A character "killed" in this manner must make a sanity check or lose a sanity point upon returning to Hell.
            <p>
            After having returned to Hell, the character may choose to wait for the other party members to return, or seek a way to rejoin the party based on the circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3>Resisting Death</h3>
            The player may choose to resist returning after being reduced to zero hit points.  For each round the player must make a sanity check.  On a successful check, the character remains as a <strong>Vengeful Spirit</strong> that can still participate in an unresolved conflict.  On a failed sanity check, the character will return to Hell as above, but will suffer an additional sanity point loss.
            <p>
            The stats and powers of the <strong>Vengeful Spirit</strong> will depend on the character's alignment, and will be revealed upon this condition occurring.

            <h2>Magic Items</h2>
            Magic pervades the very essence of the planes.  Very often magic is captured into a physical form, perhaps by a deranged wizard for later use to gain an advantage over enemies or to achieve a greater goal, perhaps as a failed experiment tested and then later discarded by a lost and forgotten god, perhaps even formed naturally via a rare confluence of the elements and forces of the universe.  In any case, magic items add great power to the player characters, and are prolific throughout the planes.  The biggest question is where to find them, and how to liberate them from their owners without getting killed in the process...

            Significant magical items will be documented here for reference, revealed after being encountered.

            <h4>Fractum Ostium</h4>
            <img class="inline" src="img/ossium_mask.png">
            <p><em>Artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>

            <p>The Fractum Ostium is an ancient artifact of immense power, long thought destroyed, it is believed to be crafted by the legendary clockmaker <strong>Keller Tegya</strong> for the original Primus. Enkosee describes Tegya as being very, very old, and probably a little mad. Featured prominently in an ancient Blood War battle on the plane of Acheron, the device was broken apart, its pieces and technical diagrams scattered across the planes.</p>

            <p>When assembled and infused with an animus, the Fractum Ostium can bend space itself, connecting distant points and allowing instantaneous travel across vast distances - even between planes. It is said to bypass the normal restrictions that govern planar travel.</p>

            <p class="break"><strong>Known Fragments</strong></p>

            <p>The artifact exists in multiple pieces, each retaining a fraction of the whole's power. Six technical diagrams scattered across the planes detail the assembly of the device.</p>

            <p>Carved from ancient petrified wood and infused with planar energy, this fragment grants teleportation abilities.

            <h3 class="break">The Broken Man - A tragic origin</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Ben Pancoast</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/broken.png"></div>
            <p>
            I grew up in my family's estate with my aging aunt and uncle, their
            son, my cousin. My parents had left for a far-off realm to resolve
            an ancient dispute with another wealthy family.
            </p>
            <p>

            I was always an academic, bookish type. I spent my childhood
            looking at the tomes and scrolls and parchments, paintings and
            drawings, and obscure artefacts that lined the estate's shelves and
            walls, handed down through my family over ages. As I grew, and my
            aunt and uncle succumbed to their age, I perused the estate's
            collection with ever-growing scholarly curiosity. In time, I would
            devote my life to doing avid research, learning ancient tongues and
            seeking lost pages and relics, with a remarkable affinity for
            convincing erstwhile collectors of similar relics and writings to
            share them with me, sometimes even to keep.

            </p>
            <p>
            I studied, and I learned. But I never really believed in any of it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, my cousin was enjoying the best of life. With
            extraordinary popularity and easy charm, he hosted grand parties
            with guests influential, mysterious, or both. At court and in the
            merchant halls, he was content to squander the family's wealth on
            revelry, failing trades and shaky land deals. He would routinely
            ridicule and deride me, teasing "are you sniffing in those dusty
            scrolls again, cousin?"

            </p>
            <p>
            But behind his guise of irresponsible playboy, he believed all of
            it. And he never let on. His understanding of the importance and
            value of the tomes and artefacts surpassed mine, and in truth, his
            apparently shaky deals secretly advanced a dark agenda. But he
            lacked the discipline and scholarship to comprehend the most arcane
            of family's eldritch treasures. I could comprehend the storied
            arcana, but I did not understand. I did not or would not see. This
            blindness would become my undoing.

            </p>
            <p>
            Eventually, my cousin pretended to take a passing interest in my
            studies. Feigning disinterest, he elicited, "Tell me what the big
            deal is with all these, with all of this. You've wasted so much of
            your life on them."

            </p>
            <p>
            "Start with, um... Oh, how about that one?"

            </p>
            <p>
            And so one day, I shared, and I began to read aloud. And to
            demonstrate.

            </p>
            <p>
            But though I believed I was academically explaining the tomes and
            scrolls, I was unwittingly working through dark, arcane rituals. My
            cousin's interest wasn't feigned at all, and his cohort of fellow
            believers were hiding nearby in our estate, an estate
            purpose-built, which concealed chambers and sigils for just such an
            occasion. And so, my fall:

            </p>
            <p>
            <em>
            I finally reach the end of the recitation, and my cousin asks, "So,
            now what happens?"

            </p>
            <p>
            And I answer, "well according to the text, there would need to be
            some sort of betrayal and sacrifice. Whatever that means."

            </p>
            <p>
            "I think it means this, cousin," he sneers.

            </p>
            <p>
            And he looks into my eyes as he plunges an accursed dagger into my
            heart.

            </p>
            <p>
            As the light begins to fade from my eyes, and the forces of evil
            cackle with glee at their newest sacrifice, I find determination
            enough to choke out "You knew? You knew all along??? Why?  Why
            cousin?!?"

            </p>
            <p>
            "You see, cousin, a trade must be made to summon power here. Thank
            you. Truly."

            </p>
            <p>
            A portal to Hell begins to open, and the ritual continues that will
            allow a devil-spawn to take my place in the mortal realm, as I take
            its place in Hell.

            </p>
            <p>
            This final ritual, a missing link written on an ancient scroll kept
            hidden from me for all these past years, requires the creation of a
            Hellish torment in the mortal realm. And so I am wrenched back to
            consciousness and made to suffer through unknowable hours of
            Hell-worthy torture: skin is flayed from my flesh, flesh carved
            from my limbs, limbs torn from my body. When at last the torment is
            adequate, and the portal is stable enough for the transfer, the
            cursed dagger that trapped me in near-death during my agony is
            withdrawn from my heart and drawn across my throat.

            </p>
            <p>
            And as I fade from consciousness, with the last remaining drops of
            my lifeblood spattering into the sigils on the floor, I gurgle
            "Gods forgive me; what have I done!? Someone, something, please,
            spare me this fate, and give me a chance to right this wrong..."

            </p>
            <p>
            Fatally betrayed by my own kin, I feel myself hurtling down toward
            eternal damnation, pummeled by debris and fragments of the ritual
            chamber and its furnishings that were drawn through the gaping
            portal with me.

            </p>
            <p>
            Passing through plane after plane of different overlapping
            realities, I approach my destination, and I plummet toward a sea of
            tortured agonized souls, their screams in eternal pain reaching up
            toward me, joining my choked bleats of terror. What little remains
            of my body starts to disincorporate, tattered remnants of flesh and
            bone sear away as my fall approaches its end.

            </p>
            <p>
            And then something answers.

            </p>
            <p>
            The unseen presence of some vast cosmic power says deeply in my
            mind "very well, mortal."

            </p>
            <p>
            As the sound of the voice trails off, darkness rises around me,
            muffling the cries from Hell below.  The shards and remnants from
            the ritual chamber start to stick to what remains of my shattered
            corpse. There is a moment of intense, wrenching vertigo. And then
            all is darkness.

            <h3 class="break">Bandito - Gransalto's Story</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Chris Johnson</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/bandito.png"></div>
            <p>
            Born into a large Harengon family living on the outskirts of
            Waterdeep, this bunny-kin was the runt of the litter.
            Interestingly, his leap was greater than the rest of hte litter,
            earning him the name Gransalto ("Big Leap"). One day, when he was
            still very young, a group of thugs working for Xanathar, the
            infamous beholder who controlled much of the criminal underworld of
            Waterdeep, raided Gransalto's home and kidnapped him. The carnage
            of the harengon was abominable. They tormented and burned the homes
            of the harengon, and raided and took anything of value. Curiously,
            one of the bandits found poor Gransalto attempting to hide in a
            small nook in a cave. Upon being discovered, Gransalto leaped his
            biggest leap, and attempted to escape, but the raiders were too
            many, and ultimately, he was captured in a bag, to be brought back
            to Xanathar as a gift for his entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gransalto was forced to perform dangerous stunts to entertain
            Xanathar. And eventually, as Gransalto earned some level of trust
            with his captors, and worked to earn his way to more valuable
            tasks, they gave him jobs of thievery and message delivery, and
            even more unsavory tasks by some of Xanathar's criminal associates.
            Over time, he became more skilled in these unsavory arts and was
            even given the nickname "Bandito" by Xanathar, which they all began
            calling him. Unfortunately it started as a gag, teasing him with
            the sing-songy sound of his given nickname of his parents, but
            ultimately, it gave him purpose, and helped him fit in... so he
            went with it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite being forced into a life of crime and servitude, Bandito
            never forgot his desire for freedom and a better life. He secretly
            worked on perfecting his thievery and sword and dagger skills,
            hoping to one day steal enough to escape and fight for freedom to
            live a peaceful life. As Bandito grew older and proved himself
            harmless to Xanathar, he became increasingly trusted by him and was
            given more dangerous tasks to perform. He despised the life he was
            living but knew he had to continue to do what it took to survive
            and one day earn his freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
            One fateful evening, Xanathar, in an effort to keep his friends
            close, and enemies closer, invited all the major crime bosses in
            Waterdeep for a poker game. Manshoon, the most powerful crime boss
            other than Xanathar was a particularly special and important guest.
            Xanathar guild and Manshoon guild had been in a careful stalemate,
            but Xanathar had a plan to usurp his power in the midst of this
            poker game, and rob Manshoon while keeping him occupied with the
            poker game. The tensions and stakes continued to rise until
            Manshoon pressed Xanathar for a raise which he could not back away
            from, and put in a commitment chip, indicating his loyalty to
            Manshoon. The room went quiet. Could this be the Xanathar offering
            a partnership with Manshoon? How could he possibly open himself up
            to be subservient to Manshoon!? When the cards landed, and it
            appeared Xanathar lost, it was revealed that it was not, in fact,
            the Xanathar commitment chip, but Bandito's commitment chip he had
            put in. Manshoon smiled evilly, having become aware of the emerging
            strength of life Bandito represented, and knew this would satisfy
            his Patron. Manshoon smirked at the Xanathar, thanking him for his
            offering, and reminding him that Manshoon sees all, and that the
            attempted robbery was thwarted, reminding Xanathar of his
            weaknesses and Manshoon’s strength. With a smirk, Manshoon spins on
            his heels, grabs Bandito, and saunters out of the room.
            </p>
            <p>
            The discovery of Manshoon’s trickery infuriated Xanathar - which is
            something Bandito had seen before, but this dance had been
            carefully orchestrated, and to lose to Manshoon at this point would
            surely have left Xanathar in a fury like no other. Bandito watched
            the ritual knife thrust down into his chest, and wondered if this
            change would present him in some way, a new way to find his freedom
            and a better life…
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Verthandi - A finder's tale</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Chris Sweitzer</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/Verthandi.png"></div>
            <p>
            Fenrir the Finder stumbled out of the hospital on uneasy legs. Bile
            rose up in his throat, forcing him to stop to steady himself
            despite his desire to get away as quickly as possible. He had never
            seen such a monstrosity before, but that wasn’t even the worst
            part. It spoke. And what it told him frightened him more than
            anything he had ever experienced before in his life.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir found people. He was very good at his trade, having found a
            total of sixty-three people so far out of a total of sixty-four
            attempts. That one failure, early in his career, used to bother
            him, but no longer. It was that failure, and the elimination of his
            perfect record, that drove him to accept more chancy, and therefore
            more lucrative, opportunities, and he hadn’t messed one up yet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Usually the person he was looking for was simply in hiding from
            whomever was seeking them. A little legwork, a few spells, and he
            could verify and deliver the location of the absconder to his
            employer. This one, however, was different. He knew that from the
            beginning. He should have turned it down. He would have, had he
            stopped worrying about his unbroken streak. There had been similar
            offers in the past that he had rejected, before his failure. Even
            afterwards there were some jobs that he knew were impossible, or
            that he knew would end up with the person he found murdered by the
            person seeking them, that he declined to take.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was the druids. That’s why he took it. His one failure had been
            when he was looking for a druid. And now he was doing it again,
            trying to find a druid. And not just any druid, but the second
            highest ranking druid in the Druidic Circle of Infinite Rainbows,
            the most well known group of druids in the entire region. Druids
            have a reputation of being wool-headed, thinking about butterflies
            and flowers, but he knew better. Nature was as cutthroat as any
            back alley gambling den.
            </p>
            <p>
            The job had started innocently enough. He received a request to find
            Kenrik the Many, who was known for his ability to take the form of
            a staggering number of animals, from the Hierophant himself. Kenrik
            was the Hierophant’s right hand man. He was the one who did most of
            the work, while the Hierophant contemplated humanity’s place in
            nature, or so the lower ranks of the circle suggested.
            </p>
            <p>
            Not that he actually met the Hierophant. He wasn’t nearly important
            enough. He had met with some rank and file druid by the name of
            Tumeric at Kenrik’s home at the compound that housed the
            high-ranking druids of the Circle of Infinite Rainbows, which was
            the last place the errant druid had been seen some six weeks
            earlier. Of course it wasn’t strange for someone with the
            responsibilities of running the day-to-day operations of the circle
            to be away for months at a time, but he had been expected to meet
            with the Hierophant for their yearly conference on the state of the
            circle a week earlier and yet was nowhere to be found.  Attempts to
            communicate magically to Kenrik had failed, attempts to magically
            locate Kenrik had failed, and now the Hierophant wanted to know
            where his second had gone off to and why.
            </p>
            <p>
            Walking into Kenrik’s home was the first warning sign. Fenrir had
            the uncanny ability to walk into a place and immediately know what
            was important and what was superfluous. There were differences
            between the home of someone who had been kidnapped and someone who
            had fled. But Kenrik’s abode had neither. There were no signs of
            struggle. There were also no signs of someone who had left of their
            own accord. There was absolutely nothing. Actually, it was worse
            than that. The entire home looked staged. All homes, whether lived
            in or not, have something out of place. They have something askew
            or missing. This place was perfect.  Everything was where it should
            be. Everything looked completely normal. It was disconcerting to
            Fenrir. He should have thanked Tumeric and left right then, but he
            didn’t, and truth be told, it was because he was afraid what people
            would say if he failed to find a second druid. “Don’t hire Fenrir
            to find druids,” people would say. He knew it was silly, but then,
            people were fickle, and finding people was his livelihood.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since Kenrik’s house provided no clues, and magical means turned up
            nothing (not that Fenrir didn’t try, even though the druids had
            already done much more than he could muster),he consigned himself
            to doing the job the hard way. In order to find out where Kenrik had
            gone, he had to find out where he had been. Kenrik travelled all
            around the region to visit with the various druids of the circle.
            And so Fenrir did the same. And that’s where the job went from
            disconcerting to disquieting. None of the druids had met with
            Kenrik lately. Some of them hadn’t seen him in five years. Some
            hadn’t seen him in eight. Some had never met him at all, but only
            remembered his predecessor. It didn’t seem possible or plausible.
            How could Kenrik had met with the Hierophant every year and told
            him what the circle was doing if he wasn’t meeting with the
            circle’s members? What exactly was Kenrik doing when he travelled
            around the area if he wasn’t meeting with members? Where was he
            going?
            </p>
            <p>
            Since Kenrik wasn’t going to where druids were, he had to be going
            where they weren’t.  Druids spent most of their time in nature.
            They lived in forests, in swamps, high on mountaintops, or deep In
            valleys. They didn’t live in cities. So that is where Fenrir went.
            He thought it was a long shot. After all, why would a druid go to a
            city? But he immediately found that’s exactly where Kenrik had
            gone. And not just one city, but every city. Every place where more
            than a few people gathered and lived together he found that Kenrik
            had visited. And now the job wasn’t disquieting anymore. In fact,
            it screamed at him to get out and run away as fast as possible. But
            it was too late. He had spent too much time, and too much money, to
            give up. And the job had its hooks into him now. He had to find out
            what Kenrik was doing, and the only way to do that was to find him
            and ask.
            </p>
            <p>
            Kenrik had been meeting with every magical guild in every major
            city in the region. It wasn’t just some of them. It wasn’t even
            most of them. It was all of them. As the second ranking member of
            the most powerful druid circle, they all had no problem opening
            their doors to him. And what harm could it do? He was just a druid.
            </p>
            <p>
            It appeared, at first glance, that he was just doing research into
            druidic matters. Every magical guild and group had their libraries
            and archives, and Kenrik would spend time in each.  Most kept track
            of which books and papers the druid looked at in order to make sure
            that if he found anything of interest, they would know where it was
            he had been looking.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was all books about nature and herbs and animals. Exactly what
            one would expect from a druid. There was nothing out of ordinary
            about the books, except that every single one was one that Fenrir
            had seen before. He had seen them in a very specific place. He had
            seen them in the home of Kenrik. Kenrik was doing research in books
            that he already owned. It made no sense. Only, it did to Fenrir.
            Kenrik was looking for something specific, but needed to hide what
            he was looking for. So he spent time looking at books he had
            already read to mask what he was really looking for. And what he
            was looking for wasn’t a book, but a place.
            </p>
            <p>
            At first he thought every book was one Kenrik already owned, but
            after traveling back to Kenrik’s home to check, he found that
            wasn’t the case. There was one book that showed up in the list that
            wasn’t in Kenrik’s home library. It wasn’t anything special. It was
            simply called “The Healing of Curses.” It wasn’t even a rare book.
            He found a copy in his home city and read it cover to cover. There
            was nothing in it that was particularly novel or eye-opening. But
            Fenrir knew there had to be something about that book. Kenrik must
            have been trying to figure out how to lift some kind of curse, but
            if so, the contents of that particular book would not have been
            much help. It was rudimentary. Any hedge wizard or cleric could
            probably do everything described in the book. Even Kenrik probably
            knew more about healing.
            </p>
            <p>
            If it wasn’t the contents of the book, Fenrir thought, it had to be
            the origin. The book was written by a cleric, of course, who
            resided at a hospital that specialized in difficult to cure magical
            diseases. Fenrir had actually heard of it. It was situated in a
            remote region away from any major city, which made sense. People
            worry about diseases from such places getting into densely
            populated areas, and they had to be built where few people lived.
            There was a nearby town, of course, but it didn’t even have a
            hundred people in it.
            </p>
            <p>
            And so Fenrir decided to travel to this town and the hospital that
            had been built on its outskirts to find anything about the druid he
            had now spent several months looking for. The town itself was
            nothing special. He stayed at the only inn. Everyone was very nice.
            No one remembered seeing a druid showing up in the past half year,
            but then, he didn’t expect that they would. The hospital looked
            exactly as he expected. It was a big imposing building with few
            windows, but a pleasant demeanor. And with every step he took up
            the main steps, he felt his gut tighten. He felt the same feeling
            he felt when first looking at Kenrik’s home. He walked inside and
            was met by a kind young priest who asked him what ailment he was
            afflicted by and how they could help. When he explained who it was
            he was looking for, expecting either a denial of their existence or
            at least refusal to acknowledge their admittance, he was surprised
            by the young man’s response. It was sadness. Kenrik was there. In
            that very hospital. But they had, so far, been unable to help him.
            Somehow Fenrir expected it to be harder. And when he asked to see
            him, the priest readily agreed to take him. In hindsight, he should
            have known something was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
            Most druids, apart from the most remedial, can turn into animals.
            Kenrik was the foremost expert at doing so, except maybe for the
            Hierophant himself, although he never appeared in public anymore,
            so no one really could compare the two. The creature that lived in
            Kenrik’s hospital room appeared to be made from every beast that
            Kenrik could transform into.  It wasn’t just a chimera, made of a
            few different animals, but a gestalt of nature. Every limb, of
            which a dozen sprouted from Kenrik’s torso, was made from several,
            if not hundreds of different creatures. Scales and feathers
            sprouted like wild grass from every exposed piece of skin. Talons
            and claws and hands and paws grasped and clasped, ripping and
            tearing at itself in a grotesque menagerie. The torso was still
            human, but heaved and groaned with animal faces covering it, all
            moaning and screaming, but without sound. In fact the whole room
            was deathly silent except for the scraping of skin as a nail or
            claw scratched against skin, opening new wounds on top of
            half-healed old ones.
            </p>
            <p>
            And there was blood everything. The priests had obviously tried to
            keep the druid clean, but the constant scratching and biting and
            thrashing caused a constant spray of blood that covered every
            nearby surface in the room. No doubt some of the blood was from the
            priests who got too close and accidentally slashed by a flailing
            arm or leg.  And despite all of this. Despite all the horror of
            Kenrik’s body, what truly disturbed Fenrir the most was its head.
            He had been given a portrait of Kenrik, so he knew what he looked
            like. And there was no doubt that the head upon this creature was
            that of Kenrik’s. But where one would expect to see a visage of
            pain and horror, was one of quiet contemplation.  Despite the
            seething limbs and gnashing faces covering his body, Kenrik looked
            as serene as if he was sitting by a river enjoying a light breeze
            off the water. And as Fenrir approached, his eyes opened and he
            looked at Fenrir and he said, “Hello Fenrir. Good to see you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir went back to his room at the inn after leaving the hospital.
            He must have, since that’s where he found himself, although had few
            memories of his walk back from the hospital.  He was still having a
            hard time processing what Kenrik had told him.
            </p>
            <p>
            “I knew you would find me,” Kenrik had said, as calmly as if he was
            discussing the weather.
            </p>
            <p>
            “How?” Croaked Fenrir.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Who else would he send to find me? You are the best at what you
            do.” Kenrik had explained.
            </p>
            <p>
            “What do you mean?” Asked Fenrir. “Who do you think sent me?”
            </p>
            <p>
            “The Hierophant, of course.” And for the first time, Fenrir saw
            emotion pass over Kenrik’s face. A look of disgust and fear
            appeared, but only for an instant. Most of would missed it, but
            Fenrir missed very little, even in his current state.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Well, yes,” Fenrir explained. “He did send me, although I never
            actually met with him.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “Better that you hadn’t. Very few meet with the Hierophant and
            emerge unchanged, as you can see by my current predicament.” Fenrir
            was stunned. Kenrik’s curse, and that’s what it had to be for him
            to be here, was caused by the Hierophant? Continuing, Kenrik said
            “That is how he keeps us in line. It’s how he keeps us from
            betraying his secret.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “His secret?” Fenrir was perplexed. What was Kenrik talking about?
            </p>
            <p>
            “Yes, his secret. And now that you’re here, I can reveal his
            secret, and finally be cured of this curse, or die in the attempt.
            You can go back and reveal it and the Hierophant’s reign of horror
            will finally be at an end.”
            </p>
            <p>
            The attempt to remove Kenrik’s curse was scheduled for midnight
            that very night. But Fenrir had no plans to stick around for it. He
            wasn’t even going to be in town by that time. He wanted to get as
            far away from the hospital and the Hierophant as possible. The
            secret Kenrik had spoken to him had been very simple, but it had
            chilled Fenrir to his very core.
            </p>
            <p>
            “The Hierophant is a mind flayer.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir was no hero. He was no adventurer who slew monsters by the
            dozen. He had heard of the Nine, who had killed a mind flayer
            almost as an aside while also slaughtering two dragons and a dozen
            dark dwarves and their allies, but to him, the Illithid were
            creatures of nightmares who would suck out your mind and leave you
            a husk. He had to get away. He had to escape this place before the
            Hierophant found out where he had gone. But it was already too
            late.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Hello Fenrir,” a new voice said from behind him. “Good to see
            you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            The next morning a maid screamed after she opened the door to
            Fenrir’s room and found him sitting in a chair, a smiling grimace
            on his face, the top of his skull removed, and nothing but
            emptiness inside his head.
            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi, better known as the Hierophant, headed quickly towards
            the hospital where Kenrik was. He had consumed Fenrir’s thoughts,
            and his brain, so he knew Fenrir hadn’t had the opportunity to tell
            anyone his secret, but if these priests managed to cure Kenrik of
            the curse Verthandi had laid upon him, then he could still reveal
            it to everyone else in the circle, and Verthandi would be ruined.
            It had taken decades to subvert and take over the circle, and now,
            just as he was about ready to have his improved beasts, Verthandi
            refused to call them aberrations like other did, supplant the
            generic creatures of this world, he couldn’t lose his most powerful
            tool. Kenrik had to die, as did the priests of the hospital where
            he lay.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir’s thoughts still swirled through Verthandi’s head, as always
            happened after a meal. He was impressed by the young man. He had
            been observant and quick witted. Very few would have found Kenrik’s
            hiding place. And even fewer would have seen it for what it really
            was.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s an odd thought, pondered Verthandi. He was through the front
            doors of the hospital by now, tearing apart the priests who
            attempted to stop him. He also consumed their brains, but they were
            simpletons. What had Fenrir seen that so disturbed him?
            </p>
            <p>
            More priests appeared, only to fall to Verthandi. He arrived at
            Kenrik’s room, but they had already moved him. Thanks to the
            informed gleamed by the minds of the priests Verthandi had
            consumed, he already knew they had taken him to a chamber beneath
            the hospital, where the true work was done.
            </p>
            <p>
            True work? Verthandi thought. The removal of curses was their work.
            Why am I thinking about their true work? It was Fenrir, he
            realized. Fenrir had seen this place, and it had disturbed him. It
            wasn’t Kenrik’s appearance or even Verthandi’s secret that had so
            unnerved the man. It was this hospital. Maybe not on a conscious
            level, but there was something about this hospital that was wrong.
            It wasn’t a place a healing. It was something else. It was a place
            of suffering. Verthandi burst into a large chamber. Kenrik was
            strapped to a table in the middle, surrounded by thirteen priests.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Hello Verthandi. It’s good to see you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Kenrik had sold his soul. And he did so gladly, to protect his
            circle, and the world, from the alien horror that the Illithid who
            had supplanted the previous Hierophant represented. The priests of
            this hospital—he laughed. It was no more a hospital than the
            Hierophant’s aberrations were “improved beasts.” These priests were
            devil worshippers, or maybe even devils themselves. And now they
            had what they wanted. One of the most powerful druids in the world.
            Not him, of course. He was powerful indeed, but he offered them
            something greater. An Illithid druid. A hierophant. And not just
            its soul, but its entire being. Sure, he would die, and spend
            eternity in torment, but it was worth it to protect that which he
            loved.
            </p>
            <p>
            “He almost figured it out,” said Verthandi. “He saw what this
            hospital really was, and who these priests were.” The priests had
            shifted their spell from Kenrik to Verthandi by now.  He could feel
            the magical cords tightening around his body.
            </p>
            <p>
            “I know,” replied Kenrik. “He would have figured it out much
            earlier had I not weakened his judgement a little.” The ground
            began to crack. Fissures appeared around Verthandi.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Oh? How did you do that?” Verthandi asked. The fissures opened up,
            steam rising from the depths below.
            </p>
            <p>
            “A decade ago I sent him to find another druid. One that
            disappeared after meeting with the Hierophant. Of course I knew
            he’d never find him.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “I don’t remember meeting with a druid that disappeared.” A loud
            crack sounded, and the floor of the chamber began to fall away in
            pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Of course not, you weren’t the Hierophant at the time.” Kenrik
            laughed. “You were the druid who disappeared.” Verthandi remembered
            now. That was the day he had eaten the brain of the previous
            Hierophant and taken his place. Beneath him, a portal was opening
            up.  He could see into its depths. The ground beneath his feet gave
            away and he plummeting downwards. The last thing he heard was
            Kenrik’s voice. “Goodbye Verthandi. It was good to see you one
            final time.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Kenrik left the ruins of the hospital on two normal feet.
            Apparently the curse had not survived Verthandi’s demise. The devil
            worshippers were surprisingly fair about the exchange.  They let
            him keep his life. They still had a claim on his soul, but he could
            surely work something out. Perhaps trade a few other souls for his.
            Kenrik shuddered. What was he thinking? He had to get back to the
            circle. He had to find more sacrifices for the devils below.  Young
            Tumeric would be perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
            Oh no, thought Kenrik. The new Hierophant, however, smiled.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Crokiak - The Shaper</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Dave Feldman</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/crokiak.png"></div>
            <p>
            Crokiak had always been fascinated with the workings of machines
            and gadgets. As a young Githzerai, he spent countless hours
            tinkering with clockwork devices and exploring the mysteries of
            magic. However, his fidgety nature and constant tinkering were not
            well-received by his monastic comrades. They viewed his
            preoccupation with machines as a distraction from their meditative
            practices and shunned him for his lack of focus.

            </p>
            <p>

            Despite their disdain, Crokiak persisted in his tinkering and
            eventually found a place of refuge in the monastery library. As the
            librarian, he spent his days surrounded by books, maps, and ancient
            tomes filled with the knowledge of generations of Githzerai
            scholars.
            </p>
            <p>


            After years of being shunned by his fellow Githzerai monks, Crokiak
            left the library and sought solace and purpose in the Plane of
            Mechanus, where he spent several years deepening his understanding
            of machines and constructs. The Modrons of Mechanus were initially
            skeptical of his tinkering, but they soon came to respect Crokiak's
            ingenuity and his unique perspective on the intricate workings of
            the multiverse.

            </p>
            <p>

            Under their tutelage, Crokiak delved deeper into the arcane
            mysteries of machines and constructs, studying ancient tomes and
            experimenting with new designs. He developed a particular
            fascination with the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, a massive
            machine that powered the entire plane and maintained its perfect
            order.  As he worked, Crokiak's mind became sharper and more
            focused than ever before. He developed an encyclopedic knowledge of
            mechanical devices and magical constructs, and he honed his skills
            in crafting intricate clockwork devices.

            </p>
            <p>

            After a harrowing experience working on a project in the Modron
            Catherdal in Regulus in which he barely escaped with his life,
            Crokiak returned to the monastery in Limbo to add his knowledge to
            library where he first discovered his love of machines.  One day,
            while lost in thought among the stacks of books, Crokiak overheard
            one of the head monks talking in hushed tones about a forbidden
            spell. The monk spoke of a powerful incantation that could
            resurrect the ancient dragon god Null and restore the glory of the
            Githzerai empire.

            </p>
            <p>

            Crokiak knew that such dark magic was strictly forbidden and could
            have catastrophic consequences. He resolved to confront the head
            monk and convince him to abandon his dangerous quest.  But before
            Crokiak could act, the head monk absconded with the forbidden tome,
            disappearing into the monastery's inner sanctum. Fearing the worst,
            Crokiak decided to follow him and retrieve the book before it was
            too late.

            </p>
            <p>

            As he crept through the darkened corridors of the inner sanctum,
            Crokiak heard the head monk chanting the forbidden spell. In a
            moment of panic, Crokiak stumbled into the room, unwittingly
            triggering the completion of the spell.  With a blinding flash of
            light, Crokiak was hurled through space and time, his body ripped
            apart by the raw power of the spell. When he awoke, he found
            himself in a place of torment and suffering, surrounded by demons
            and devils.

            </p>
            <p>

            Crokiak had unknowingly damned his soul to Hell, and there was no
            escape. Trapped in this infernal realm, Crokiak vowed to use his
            knowledge of machines and magic to find a way out and seek revenge
            against the monk that had betrayed Crokiak and his people

            </p>

            <em>
                <p>
                She remembers nothing of her angelic existence, apart from the feeling of boundless joy and eternal peace in all things. And she remembers the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                The archangel Xandriel stood before her, surrounded by choirs and hosts of angels. He continued speaking,”...thou shalt hereafter be called Feuriel, and thou art hereby cast from Heaven---”
                </p>
                <p>
                At the instant the last syllable was uttered, the pain began, and it never stopped. Joy and peace were ripped from her, and physical pain accompanied it. She felt a vertigo, as if she was falling, though she could see nothing but blinding white light, which hurt also.
                </p>
                <p>
                She felt the pain of death, 666 times, as she passed through the mortal world repeatedly, still blinded but seeing only a dismal shade of gray. She felt again and again the futile agony of humanity. She remembers thinking, “So this is why they are as they are.”
                </p>
                <p>
                This was just the beginning of her journey, for the meaningless gray began to deepen into an ominous darkness. Deeper and deeper she fell, the trauma increasing. She felt her body burning, her wings being seared off, only to be reformed and destroyed again. Over and over, deeper and deeper, into the eternal suffering that is Hell.
                </p>
                <p>
                As an immortal being, she does not perceive time, so it can’t be said how long the fall lasted. But it had a beginning, and an end. The end, is in pure darkness, tangible evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                She can feel herself surrounded by beings of palpable hatred. Like a cornered animal, she brandishes her sword and presents her shield, which she still clutches, against the darkness. Terrified, but not afraid, Feuriel calls out to them, “Do unto me what you will! You cannot know the suffering I have already endured. Whatever you have for me, tis but a drop in the ocean, compared to what I have lost, where I have been. You will never know...”
                </p>
                <p>
                Her sight starts to return. She wishes it hadn’t.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Feuriel, or “Fury” as she can be called, is a being of contradictions. A stalwart of Heaven, conscripted to Hell, she is both beautiful and grotesque. Her pale flawless skin is in places split open, exposing blackened flesh and silvery bones. Her alluring shape is interrupted by gaping sinews where her form is not whole. One eye continuously weeps blood. Her long, unkempt, jet-black hair frames intoxicating, unwavering eyes which change color to match her mood. From her delicate shoulders sprout the useless remnants of mighty wings, charred and broken.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel’s demeanor is similarly contradictory. She is both confident and scared, powerful and frail. She distrusts everyone yet will ally with anyone. The only person she fully trusts is herself, and that is the person most likely to deceive her. She clings to a moral code, keeping her word above all else, and keeping her suffering within, except to inflict suffering on those who deserve it through their choices and actions. She believes she is superior to others, yet she feels inferior. She peers intently at a world she tries not to see, lost while knowing her place, in a realm completely foreign yet strangely familiar. Her self-control dances with anger; hope oscillates with despair. Her faith is being tested and she doesn’t know if she wants it to prevail or not.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel is a paladin of Torm, the lawful good God of duty, loyalty, and obedience. She still serves him, though she is unsure how. She wields an ornate longsword and a brilliant bronze shield whose insignia has been melted beyond recognition. Her lithe body is draped with scraps of white clothing and fragmented armor. She no longer has a halo.

            <h3 class="break">Aldoon of Gora - Nothing Special</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Steve Graham</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/aldoon.png"></div>
            <p>
            Aldoon of Gora was nothing special. The middle male child in a
            family of 9 children, he did not consider his life to have been
            easy despite the elevated position his house held in the Loxodon
            city of Erridon. He was not very smart, he was not exceptionally
            strong, he was not very brave, he was not exceptionally devout.
            Aldoon chose service with the order of The Sister, Iolensis,
            Loxodon goddess of the Seasons and Storms, mostly because it
            allowed him to serve away from the city and his family. Everyone in
            Clan Gora devoted their lives to the Gods - that was a foregone
            conclusion - but it was the mountain solitude that he really
            craved. He had never really felt the embrace of The Sister as his
            cohorts described.
            </p>
            <p>

            Never excelling in anything, and never seeming to completely devote
            himself to his patroness, he had disappointed his family
            continuously for 97 years. And now, in his early adulthood the only
            place he really felt at home was on the mountain trails high above
            the city, away from his family’s home. He knew this terrain like
            the tip of his trunk and he felt he knew his job here, if not his
            purpose.
            </p>
            <p>

            He was an acolyte of the order of Iolensis, charged with helping to
            maintain the shroud of secrecy over the valley. Erridon was an
            ancient city for the Loxodon people, and the mountains surrounding
            it held three holy sites, sacred not only to the Loxodon people.
            The mountains protected the valley, the city, and the holy sites
            alike, keeping at bay the lands of humans, elves, and the like.
            Sister of Seasons and Storms, Iolensis, lent her favor to her
            followers that they might help protect the valley with thick fog
            and violent storms in the high mountain passes.
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon knew the trails and passes, glades and meadows of these
            mountains, and was adept at creating the fog and some winds but did
            not know how to invoke the great storms his leaders (and some of
            his cohorts) could bring. He did not know if he ever would.
            </p>
            <p>

            In fact, on a brisk evening in the days teetering on the brink of
            winter, there were many things Aldoon of Gora did not know. He did
            not know that 8 days earlier, his father had died of unknown causes
            on the street while walking home from Council. He did not know that
            7 days prior his brother Colytus (his younger brother, and the
            youngest of the 9 siblings) had been sent into the mountains to
            retrieve him and bring him back for the funeral rites.
            </p>
            <p>

            Colytus had been sent to a camp Aldoon’s party had left a day
            before, and so missed him by half a day. He did not know of the
            missed connection or that Colytus, unaccustomed to the ancient,
            winding, crumbing pathways, had misstepped, and his brother and his
            2 companions had tumbled a thousand feet to their death.
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon did not know that on the morning of the previous day, with
            Colytus now 2 days overdue from his return, his eldest brother had
            taken ill with a mysterious malady. He wasted away quickly despite
            his great strength, and did not last past twilight. He did not know
            he was the last male of the great Gora clan.

            <p>

            Audorora, mage of The Sister, Primelepha, goddess of Knowledge,
            Law, and Magic, was going into the mountains to find her stupid
            brother. What had befallen her family in the last dayswas just too
            much. She needed to dry her eyes and get out. She needed to find
            Aldoon. She needed to find Colytus. She needed to get rid of the
            nagging, clutching feeling that something was desperately out of
            control and her family was in danger of being destroyed forever,
            and if she had just been paying attention, had <em>seen</em> it
            coming…
            </p>
            <p>

            She had been buried, completely isolated in her work for the last
            year, at least, having finally been brought into the inner conclave
            and finally given access to the ancient tomes, the knowledge of the
            true purpose of this valley. She hadn’t been paying attention to
            her family.
            </p>
            <p>

            And that last thing Aldoon said as he set back out to his mountain
            wanderings… What was it?
            </p>
            <p>

            She had said first… something like… “Glad you’re being useful.
            Helping the family.” She didn’t mean it to sound as sarcastic as it
            did. She tossed it over her shoulder as she was passing him, her
            arms full of books.
            </p>
            <p>

            And what did he say?
            </p>
            <p>

            “Yes. I’m sure when I return, I’ll have Father’s seat at council.”
            </p>
            <p>

            What did he mean by that? It was such an odd reply. She thought she
            knew what he was saying at the time. But now? Could he have done
            something? Made some deal? Set something in motion? He had never
            showed any desire to gain power or to be part of helping govern the
            city. But he could sometimes get so angry… Or was that just the
            tantrums of a child? How old was he the last time he really let her
            have it? She truly couldn’t remember.  Was he a threat?
            </p>
            <p>

            Did he know about the prophecy? She had brought her notes with her
            several times to the common areas. Had he seen? Did he have some
            secret ambition that would see opportunity in the coming lunar
            conjunction? Was he trying, in his stupid way, to become the focus
            of a misinterpreted prediction?
            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            The last prophecy of Antiquus of Endoon was taken down 327 years
            ago by no less than 6 Clerics, and none of the accounts matched. A
            large number of people had gathered for the vigil despite the
            terrifying countenance Antiquus held before finally speaking. When
            she finally spoke, it may have caught them off guard.
            </p>
            <p>

            Antiquus of Endoon was a respected oracle, having prophesied a
            horrendous plague when she was very young, and then aiding the
            Matriarchs of her day through several great calamities. She had The
            Sight, and was favored by Eritrea, the Allmother, it was sure.
            </p>
            <p>

            Near the end of her life, a servant found her one morning sitting
            bolt upright on the end of her bed, her fists white, clutching the
            bedclothes, her mouth open in a wide scream of abject terror, but
            making no sound. She stayed like that for 3 days and nights.
            </p>
            <p>

            Clerics and Mages gathered and tried to pull her out of her state,
            but to no avail. Shortly before dawn on the last night, she finally
            let loose her hoarse, agonized scream, letting her hands rize to
            her face to dig bright red scratches.
            </p>
            <p>

            Moments later she spoke. When she was finished, she would never
            speak again.
            </p>
            <p>

            Versions of the prophecy as taken down by the various clerics and
            mages present have been preserved and reproduced over the years.
            None are alike. But the account of Platann of Justa, when taken in
            context with several others, and when combined with his personal
            notes,seemed to be as close to the actual words of the oracle
            Antiquus. Or at least that is the conclusion Audorora came to as
            she studied the yellowing scrolls several months before the death
            of her and Aldoon’s father.
            </p>
            <p>
            As best as can be discerned this is what came out of the dry,
            cracked lips of Antiquus of Endoon:

                The problem was, this account was not one that was widely
            circulated. Platann was terrified of this prediction, and kept it
            to himself for years, allowing other accounts of the prophecy to
            gain prominence. Nor did Audorora take reproductions of it out of
            the halls of the Conclave. The words burned in her mind, she needed
            only the contradictory, misinterpreted versions to study.
            </p>
            <p>

            In most accounts the last two lines are completely omitted.
            Antiquus’ voice must have been failing, the words becoming a mere
            whisper, or too gravelly to make out. The prophecy ends, in many
            reproductions, and in the ones Aldoon could have seen, with the
            mistakenly quoted 8th line as a variation of “and he will be the
            chosen one.” Like this, the prophecy becomes one of family
            infighting resulting in a male of great influence coming forth to
            rule.
            </p>
            <p>

            Some males speak of this prophecy as a time to come when a male
            will cause the Matriarch to step aside and will serve as a great
            Patriarch, and bring prosperity. One without knowledge of the true
            prophecy might even be tempted, if they were foolish enough, to try
            to make it come about.
            </p>
            <p>

            The winds grow cold, and the Three Moons approach conjunction for
            the first time in hundreds of years.

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Aldoon was startled at how quickly it all went bad. The Highmark’s
            sending had come as twilight fell, his words echoing slightly in
            Aldoon’s mind.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Four approach through Draydon’s Pass. Watch the Northwalk. Keep
            them from the Circle. Let The Sister be your strength.”
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon took his position overlooking the path carved into the
            cliff-face north of the Temple of the Circle. He watched as the
            storm clouds formed overhead, heard the booming thunder, and
            watched as fog filled the pass perhaps a half mile further north,
            conjured by theHighmark and his acolytes. All was as it had been
            dozens of times, as wayward travelers were discouraged from
            entering the valley. It usually worked.
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon watched in surprise as the thick fog was dissipated in an
            instant, the storm clouds swept away. He had time to notice how
            bright the night was. The moons were all out at once, all in a
            line. The land was bathed in moonlight.
            </p>
            <p>

            Then a battle erupted.
            </p>
            <p>

            He saw the Highmark’s lightning, called from the dissipating
            clouds, strike once, twice.  Heard a booming thunderclap, and the
            crack of sundered trees. And then an explosion of fire.  It was
            almost too bright to look at at first, and after, Aldoon saw to his
            dismay that the forest at the mouth of the pass was ablaze.
            </p>
            <p>

            Not knowing what else to do, he conjured his thick fog as far as he
            could along the cliff-face walkway, making it that much more
            treacherous. He loosed the trunk-sized logs, prepared for this
            purpose, to tumble down, further blocking the pathway. He readied
            another spell - and waited.
            </p>
            <p>

            Far too soon, he was caught off-guard by his fog cloud winking out
            of existence. He saw a blur of some sort on the pathway, and began
            to cast, intending to knock whoever approached into the chasm
            below.
            </p>
            <p>

            “I don’t think so.” He heard behind him, and felt a blade pierce
            his side.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Dammit!” the voice said as Aldoon’s tough hide turned the blade a
            bit more than his attacker anticipated. He turned, reaching for the
            warhammer he hated using. It should have been mere feet away
            leaning against a stone.
            </p>
            <p>

            Instead it came crashing down on his skull and his world went black.
            </p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Aldoon awoke slowly, realizing he was chained to the ground, his
            arms and legs spread wide. His side still felt on fire from the
            wound he’d suffered earlier, but it was not the only injury.  He
            had not been gently brought to this place.
            </p>
            <p>

            As he looked at the carved stone ceiling he realized he was in the
            Temple of the Circle.  And his limbs were chained to spikes newly
            pounded into the holy Circle that dominated the floor of the
            chamber.
            </p>
            <p>

            As he gathered his senses, he saw a robed human weaving magic that
            tore apart the tree-shaped stone altar at the head of the room to
            pluck the Emerald of Eritrea from the heart of the tree. He tossed
            the emerald aside. In its place, he enclosed the tree shaped
            stonework around a dark bloodstone - deep crimson with a golden
            swirl of something captured inside. The stonework darkened and
            drooped as though decaying.
            </p>
            <p>

            “You sure the Elephant guy’ll work?” someone said.
            </p>
            <p>

            “It must.” the robed man said.
            </p>
            <p>

            “He’s awake.” someone else said.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Take care of it.” the robed man said.
            </p>
            <p>

            Another sharp crack to Aldoon’s head and sparkles lit his vision.
            </p>
            <p>

            He did not know how much time passed, but he rose out of a daze to
            find the chains tightening. Braziers were lit all around him, and
            he realized someone was shouting. Chanting.
            </p>
            <p>

            The ground beneath him seemed to be glowing an awful reddish
            yellow. He felt the ground under him… thin somehow - become less
            tangible, though it still held him.
            </p>
            <p>

            The shouted chanting grew louder, more insistent. He felt what
            seemed like an enormous claw rake down his back, digging a furrow
            deep in his flesh, and then catch in chains that wrapped his torso.
            The the claw pulled. Adrenaline flooded Aldoon’s body as he felt
            himself being stretched, pulled, torn from the world.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Aldoon!” he heard from somewhere. And then the clash of fighting.
            An explosion. A flash of lightning. It was so near and also very
            far away. He fought against the chains, tried to will himself back
            into the world. His head turned slightly and he saw Audorora, his
            sister. What was she doing here?
            </p>
            <p>

            The robed human lay at her feet, perhaps dead. Another human still
            fought behind her with another Loxodon, an acolyte of the Highmark
            named Koroom. She held aloft a staff which blazed bright silvery
            light across the room and seemed to bend and dent the air around
            Aldoon somehow.
            </p>
            <p>

            A black chain shot out of the ground behind Aldoon and wrapped
            around the staff.  Another reached out to grab ahold of Audorora’s
            ankle. She screamed. She shouted something. The chains binding
            Aldoon gave a tremendous lurch and he was pulled downward, crushing
            him against the floor and digging with excruciating force on his
            limbs. Somehow it felt as though he would soon burst through the
            floor itself.
            </p>
            <p>

            A blast of silvery light and Audorora was free of the chains, but
            then a blackened, clawed hand reached forth from beside Aldoon’s
            head, reaching for her. Aldoon began to feel himself slide. He
            caught his sister’s gaze. She looked at him with sadness, pity,
            disgust. He thought again: “What is she doing here?”
            </p>
            <p>

            She turned, and with a word of power her staff blazed again. The
            altar shattered, and with it the bloodstone. Aldoon felt himself
            torn downward, the chains tightening even more, if that was even
            possible. He heard all around him and in his mind, an unfathomable
            booming voice: “I will take my payment!!”
            </p>
            <p>

            Darkness engulfed him, and there was pain, and he remained awake.
            </p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Months. Years. Eons. Aldoon was dragged by his chains through
            uncountable planes for an unknowable period of time. Whatever had
            possession of him seemed to delight in dragging him, mile by mile,
            world by world, down through every possible horror to his final
            prison. No fire, no caustic slime, would melt the chains, no jagged
            stone could break them, no torment could kill him. He simply
            endured, his mind torn and twisting to somehow survive the endless
            implacable journey.
            </p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            He did not know how long he had been still. He slowly realized,
            perhaps over the course of years, that the chains were gone. He was
            in darkness, laying on stone, but not one he recognized by mere
            feel. It was somehow too hard.
            </p>
            <p>

            Over time, he raised himself, felt his surroundings, found very
            little. Jagged too-hard stones surrounded him.
            </p>
            <p>

            In one small crack he found a charred bit of some unknown wood. He
            held this for some time. Perhaps a month.
            </p>
            <p>

            Slowly, he traced the wood with his fingers, bringing his mind back
            to himself. He began to shape it, carving off bits with his
            fingernails. He found he was making a symbol, one he had known some
            time ago. It was abstract. It could have been a wave or wind or a
            blown cloud. It had a streak through the center that was supposed
            to be lightning.
            </p>
            <p>
            After holding his symbol for a day, a week, a year, he finally
            spoke.  “Iolensis.” After a moment, the symbol began to glow.

            Drow Arachnomancer Illusionist.

            <h3 class="break">Szulsto - The Mystic</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Simon Pancoast</strong></p>

            <p>Szulsto lived in a sheltered cave-house deep in the mountains. While this might seem a terrible place to live for most, it suited Szulsto and his roommate, Illistran, quite well, for they are Mystics, a strange, very small group of people with psychic powers and abilities.  The honing of one’s psychic might require isolation and contact with only other psychic beings, so the rugged, vacant span of mountains suited the two partners quite well. Szulsto had known Illistran for a very long time. They had lived in the same village when they both discovered their psychic powers and had agreed to stick together and run away to find solace together.</p>
            <p>Szulsto and Illistran are Yuan-Ti Purebloods, the lowest rank in the monstrous, infernal- creature-worshiping race that idolized being as snake-like as possible. He was born into a small, remote village of Yuan-Ti with something unheard of in Yuan-Ti society, a moral compass. He did not enjoy killing mindlessly or for fun, and did not enjoy torturing, the infernal rituals, or the killing of innocents. He thought that life should be preserved and honored. This made him something of a social outcast, the “weird one,” as diverging from Yuan-Ti standards could mark one as an enemy. When Szulsto’s psychic powers manifested one day out exploring, he knew he would have to run, or else be sacrificed in some unholy ritual. Little did he know that he could not escape this fate, that he was unknowingly walking his way into a worse fate.</p>
            <p>Szulsto woke up one day to discover that he had been bound to a table in a room he had never seen before deep in a room of his house he had never seen before. He heard mutterings in some demonic language he did not recognize and turned his head as much as he could against the straps holding his head in place would allow and saw that Illistran was chanting something quietly under his breath, holding a finely serrated knife in one hand.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />

            <p><em>“What are you doing? Why have I been bound like this while you are free?!”</em><br/>
            <em>“Oh good, you are awake!”</em> Illistran said, striding towards Szulsto, grinning wickedly. <em>“For what will come next to work, I need you conscious. I cannot have you dying on me during such a crucial moment!”</em></p>
            <p>There was suddenly a sickening, blinding pain in Szulsto’s head; Illistran had sawed Szulsto’s skull open, and then, with a dizzying, awful feeling, wrenched his brain from his skull. Szulsto used his psychic powers to keep himself alive as he sensed his brain being lifted into the air and eventually placed into some new container, he realized was another, different, empty skull.</p>
            <p><em>“Go on now,”</em> said Illistran, <em>“Connect to it. You will eventually die without a body.”</em></p>


            <p>And so Szulsto, with no other choice, bonded his brain to the new body, which he realized was a human one.</p>
            <p><em>“Well done! Oh, I am so excited for what comes next! I am going to have so much fun with you!”</em></p>
            <p>Szulsto lost perception of time. Every day was the same. He would be woken up, fed some potion that kept him alive, and would then have several “features” added to his new body every day. Mandibles, tentacles, extra limbs, more eyes, feelers, wings... there were never enough modifications made to Szulsto’s new body to satisfy Illistran. Every night, before he could rest, some or all the “features” were removed, making it almost impossible for Szulsto to adapt to his new, torturous life.</p>
            <p>Then one day, after Szulsto, against the odds, had finally started to get used to his new life, a portal was opened right in the middle of the largest wall. A voice spoke out from it.</p>
            <p><em>“Illistran, you owe me,”</em> spoke a voice that Szulsto, through his studying of infernal creatures, recognized that it belonged to a devil.</p>
            <p><em>“I know, I know!”</em> Responded Illistran.</p>
            <p><em>“You have a debt to pay. And this time, you had better give me something worth it. Your last two offerings were nowhere near adequate.”</em></p>
            <p>These words hung in the air, as Illistran seemed to be thinking his situation over. Finally, he spoke.</p>
            <p><em>“Tell you what. I give you him,”</em> Ilistran then jestured at Szulsto, who suddenly realized what was about to happen, <em>“my most prized piece of work, and never work on this project again. In turn, my debt to you will be eternally paid. Do we have a deal?”</em></p>
            <p><em>“...”</em></p>
            <p><em>“Yes,”</em> the voice said.</p>
            <p><em>“Good, Good!”</em> Cried Illistran. <em>“Now then, I can’t give you everything, only him. I will destroy all my work with your supervision, and then never attempt to work on it again.”</em></p>
            <p><em>“What do you mean by... Oh, I get it now!”</em> Said the devil, with a horrible, audible grin, as if he knew that something truly hell-worthy was about to occur.</p>
            <p><em>“But I will need your help, oh Mighty One,”</em> Illistran said.</p>
            <p><em>“But of course, my faithful one,”</em> Grinned the devil.</p>
            <p>Szulsto was suddenly bound magically in place, unable to move. He sensed, rather than heard, Illistran approaching him from behind, and heard the unsheathing of a knife.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />

            <p>Szulsto knew what was about to happen and braced himself for it.</p>
            <p>Again, Szulsto’s skull was cut open, and his brain was torn out. Keeping himself together, Szulsto “heard” Illistran speak to the devil.</p>
            <p><em>“Here you go!”</em> he said and howling with a laughter that was shared with and sounded eerily like the devil’s, lobbed Szulsto’s brain through the portal.</p>
            <p>As his brain soared to the depths of hell, he though, <em>“No. I will not be stranded like this.”</em></p>
            <p>And he gathered his psychic might, focused on what his original, Yuan-Ti body looked and felt like, and released a mighty burst that all but drained Szulsto of his psychic powers, reconstructing his Yuan-Ti body. Feeling it returning to its full function and repairing his brain of what damage had been done, he faded into unconsciousness as he hurtled towards his new home.</p>

            <h2>Non Player Characters</h2>

            <h3 class="break">Enkosee</h3>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/enkosee.png"></div>

            <p>Enkosee is the devil who greeted the newly damned souls upon their arrival in Hell. He offered them a choice: eternal torment in the flesh-pits, or service to him as his agents across the planes. Those who choose service become bound to him, compelled to carry out his bidding.</p>

            <p><strong>Appearance.</strong> Enkosee appears as a tall, distinguished humanoid devil with an air of cultivated sophistication. He dresses well and speaks with measured eloquence, bearing himself more like a noble scholar than a fiend of the infernal realms.</p>

            <p><strong>Personality.</strong> Despite his position, Enkosee is surprisingly candid and fair in his dealings. He does not lie, rewards competence generously, and punishes only when warranted. Several party members have noted that he has been more truthful with them than their own companions, a fact that chafes at their conscience. He takes genuine interest in those who serve him, often walking alongside them and asking what they truly desire, seeking to reward them in ways that align with their deepest aspirations.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy.</strong> Enkosee views Chaos as a "fundamental flaw" in creation, an "original sin" that he has dedicated his time in Hell to correcting. He sees the infernal realms as a necessary institution, a "reordering of things which left to themselves would lead to all kinds of strife." As he explains it, the so-called "good" deities enforce obedience through threat of damnation, yet hold themselves too high to carry out the punishments they decree. Hell cleans up their mess. Still, his authority is limited to this place, and there is much more he wishes to accomplish beyond its borders.</p>

            <p>He has observed "more than one cataclysm" and speaks of the world as a spinning top in its final throes, "the wobbles too large to ignore." He had hoped for more time, but "the final grains of sand in the hourglass approach."</p>

            <p><strong>Powers.</strong> Enkosee possesses formidable abilities. He can telekinetically lift and dismember opponents with a thought, keeping their organs and body parts alive and conscious even as they are separated. The remains of those who defy him are cast into the flesh-pits, a sea of writhing bodies whose pain and anguish somehow power the infernal machinery. He can engage in telepathic communication, and seems to possess knowledge of secrets that "are meant to be beyond the comprehension of mortals."</p>

            <p><strong>History.</strong> Enkosee reveals that he himself is a victim of Hell. He was betrayed by one he trusted long ago, leading to his imprisonment in this plane. He speaks of a "profound injustice" done to him, and intends to eventually set things right. The Fractum Ostium, he believes, may be his salvation, and perhaps the salvation of all who serve him.</p>

            <p><strong>Resources.</strong> Enkosee maintains a vast library and a growing museum of antiquities. He describes himself as "quite the collector of rare arcanum" and has helpers scouring the planes for curiosities. His assistant Panulis attends to his affairs, and he commands a household of lesser devils and bound souls. He has rivals among other powerful devils, and suspects spies in their employ.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Panulis</h3>
            <p><em>Twisted gnome, scribe and attendant of Enkosee</em></p>

            <p><strong>Appearance.</strong> Panulis appears at first glance to be a gnome, but something has twisted him - his skin has a reddish tint, and there is an unsettling quality to his features that marks him as a creature of Hell. He is small and unassuming, easily overlooked among the more dramatic denizens of the infernal realm.</p>

            <p><strong>Origin.</strong> Panulis was once a gnome, damned to Hell for reasons he does not discuss. Time and the nature of this place have changed him, but he retains the sharp mind and nimble fingers of his former kind. He found his place in the Scribery, one of hundreds of scribes engaged in endless writing, and somehow survived long enough to catch Enkosee's attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Role.</strong> Panulis serves a dual function. He remains based at the Scribery, where he is the keeper of certain important documents, including the Book of Rules that govern conduct in Hell. But he has also become a personal attendant to Enkosee, running errands, fetching wine, and attending to his master's affairs. It is a position of some small influence, though he is careful never to overestimate his own importance.</p>

            <p><strong>Personality.</strong> Panulis has survived in Hell by knowing things others don't and by knowing when to keep his mouth shut. He offered the party a "shortcut" through Hell that "isn't entirely allowed," suggesting a familiarity with secret passages and hidden routes. "You don't stay out of trouble as long as I have without knowing a few tricks," he said. He seemed genuinely disappointed when the party chose the "proper" route instead.</p>

            <p>He understands power. He understands that rules are made to serve those in charge, and that "the strong survive" is the only law that truly matters. Bandito found a kind of kinship with him, both small, both overlooked, both learning to navigate a world where the tall and powerful make the rules and change them when it suits their purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>Deals and Favors.</strong> Panulis claims to have "some influence" with Enkosee and can arrange things for a price. He has offered to help the party in exchange for favors of an unspecified nature in the future. Whether this is genuine helpfulness, careful positioning, or Enkosee manipulating him to manipulate them remains an open question.</p>

            <p>He was entrusted with the Book of Rules and a dusty note from Enkosee long before the party arrived - though he couldn't say exactly how long. "Could be a few months, could be a year or more." Time moves strangely in Hell, and Panulis has stopped trying to measure it.</p>

            <p><strong>Demeanor.</strong> Nervous but competent, eager to please but careful not to overstep. He speaks quickly, deflects questions he doesn't want to answer, and has a talent for being helpful without revealing too much. He knows things. He's not sharing most of them.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Mel Selene</h3>
            <p><em>Female warforged fighter, former archaeologist</em></p>

            <p>Mel Selene appears at first glance to be a human woman, but closer inspection reveals that the majority of her body is mechanical in nature, a reconstruction of metal, gears, and arcane circuitry built upon what remains of her original flesh. She moves with the deliberate precision of clockwork, yet her eyes hold a depth of emotion that seems at odds with her construction.</p>

            <p><strong>Origin.</strong> Mel was once an archaeologist and explorer who sailed the planes aboard a spelljamming vessel with her companions: <strong>Jalena</strong>, a spellcaster who threw spell after spell at their attackers until she was slain; <strong>Morkak</strong>, a warrior who took three enemies with him before falling; and <strong>Damocleus</strong>, the navigator and her closest friend, whose death left them lost and plummeting toward a crash she barely survived. They had been documenting lost events, ancient heroes, and forgotten places, remembering the unremembered, until Githyanki pirates boarded their vessel, killed her crew, burned their precious journals before her eyes, and left her broken body for dead among the wreckage.</p>

            <p>The Modrons found her. They had been guarding something of importance for millennia, their numbers dwindling, and they saw in Mel an opportunity to bolster their ranks. They saved her from death, rebuilt her with their clockwork technology, and set her to guard their charge. When she tried to leave to bring word to the families of her dead friends, to tell the story of what became of them, the Modrons deemed her "irrational" and severed her control of all but autonomic functions. She spent a millennium conscious but paralyzed, staring at the same canyon wall, unable to move, unable to speak, unable to die.</p>

            <p>The party freed her. Krokiak disconnected the Modron's control of her body, and she turned on her captors with a thousand years of rage. Now she serves the party, sworn to repay the debt of her freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Demeanor.</strong> Mel speaks of herself as having been "called Mel once," as if the name belongs to someone she used to be. She sometimes argues with herself, no, not with herself, with something inside her head. She breaks off mid-sentence to snap "No!" at nothing visible, or "Shut up, you've had your time!" Her companions have learned that the Modron personality that controlled her for a thousand years is not dead, merely disconnected from motor functions. It still speaks to her, cold and rational, objecting to her choices, offering its own logic. She argues back. To observers, she appears to suffer from some form of madness, but she insists it is all too real.</p>

            <p>Perceptive observers sometimes notice a tear trace down her mechanical face while she is speaking of other matters entirely, as if another presence grieves for something she does not know she has lost.</p>

            <p><strong>Combat.</strong> In battle, Mel is a force of controlled fury. She carries an integrated weapons system built into her mechanical frame, and her first strikes in any engagement are marked by reckless intensity, a thousand years of pent-up rage channeled into violence. She fights like someone who has nothing left to lose, because for a very long time, she didn't.</p>

            <p><strong>Relations.</strong> She has found an unexpected kinship with Krokiak, the Githzerai artificer. She makes careful distinction between his people and the Githyanki pirates who destroyed her life "present company notwithstanding," she says when the subject of vengeance against Githyanki arises.</p>

            <p><strong>The Ship.</strong> When Enkosee chartered a vessel to carry the party across the Astral Plane, fate dealt Mel a cruel hand. The spelljammer was the same ship that had waylaid her vessel a thousand years ago, not the same crew, but the same vessel, now crewed by Githyanki mercenaries, pirates, and chancers of the same breed who had slaughtered her friends. Mel confided in the party that she knew how to pilot vessels of this type, and that given the chance, she would slaughter every Githyanki aboard.</p>

            <p>During a battle with a pink astral space blob, Bandito observed Mel kick one of the Gith pirates off the ship and into the creature's maw when no one was watching. Whether this was justice, vengeance, or simply an opportunity taken remains between Mel and her conscience, if she still has one. She has not spoken of it.</p>

            <p><strong>Secret.</strong> The clockwork mechanism embedded in Mel's mechanical heart is the first fragment of the Fractum Ostium. She has never seen it, never known it was there, but its presence glows brightly to magical detection. The party has kept this secret from Enkosee, claiming she is simply another Modron unit that Krokiak subverted to their cause. How long that deception will hold is anyone's guess.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Captain Teelo Rence</h3>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/teelo.jpg"></div>
            <p><em>Centaur warrior, servant of the Lady of the Tree (deceased)</em></p>

            <p><strong>Appearance.</strong> A centaur of apparent rank and standing among his kind, called "Captain" by other centaurs. Physically indistinguishable from others of his kind, though Verthandi noted he seemed "possibly modified" in some way by the devils or by whoever ruled the land, he couldn't tell.</p>

            <p><strong>Capture and Escape.</strong> Teelo was captured during a raid on devil supply lines, an ambush by enemy forces that left many of his Fae companions dead. He played the dullard in captivity, feigning ignorance of his surroundings and rank, waiting for an opportunity to escape. That opportunity came when the party's actions drew away his hellhound guards. He seized the moment, overcame his captors, and found himself among the oddest collection of creatures he had ever seen including an Illithid. He continued his charade, assessing whether these strangers might be useful allies.</p>

            <p><strong>Personality.</strong> Pragmatic and cunning, Teelo believed that "every tool has its use and its purpose." He was willing to work with morally questionable allies, including an Illithid, if it served the cause. He carried guilt over the comrades who died in the ambush that captured him, and was determined to make amends to "Her" - the Lady of the Tree.</p>

            <p><strong>The Mythras Campaign.</strong> Teelo brought the party to Mythras and introduced them to the Lady of the Tree, who sought peace with the devil invaders. But Teelo had no intention of negotiating in good faith. He believed the talks with Ceranos were a sham, a way to locate the enemy portal so his forces could destroy it and drive the devils from the land. He was wrong.</p>

            <p>The portal was a feint. While Teelo led his centaurs to attack an empty cave, Ceranos's kobold army descended upon Mythras and burned it to the ground. The Great Tree was destroyed, its roots torn from the earth, and from those smoking ruins, servants of Hell pulled a clockwork fragment: the second piece of the Fractum Ostium.</p>

            <p><strong>Death.</strong> In the chaotic battle that followed, a three-way conflict between Teelo's forces, Ceranos's infernal army, and the party, Teelo was mortally wounded. As he lay dying, his insides no longer inside, Feuriel descended upon him in a cloud of darkness and drained the last of his life essence. His final expression was one of horror.</p>

            <p>But Feuriel witnessed something else. As Teelo's body went still, it transformed - shedding the form of a centaur and revealing something else. Whatever Teelo had truly been, he was never simply a centaur. The party never learned what this meant, or whose servant he really was.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Ceranos</h3>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/ceranos.jpg"></div>
            <p><em>Female devil, servant of Enkosee (status unknown)</em></p>

            <p><strong>Appearance.</strong> Ceranos appeared to be a standard devil, not particularly high-ranking, certainly not on the same level as Enkosee. She wore a distinctive necklace of gold clusters and ruby accents that radiated an aura of confidence and power.</p>

            <p><strong>Role.</strong> Ceranos was Enkosee's operative on the plane of Mythras, though she claimed to serve a "benefactor" who liked to keep things "compartmentalized." She made a point of telling the party that she "willingly chose" to serve - unlike them, who were bound. Whether this was truth, manipulation, or self-deception remained unclear.</p>

            <p><strong>The Mythras Operation.</strong> Ceranos tricked the water sprite Jarvik into signing a contract to "develop and exploit" the lands of Mythras. In truth, she was strip-mining the region, searching for something buried beneath the earth. The party eventually realized she was hunting a fragment of the Fractum Ostium.</p>

            <p>She proved to be a capable tactician. While Teelo believed he was using the peace negotiations to locate her portal, Ceranos was playing a deeper game. The "portal" was a feint, an empty cave. While Teelo's forces attacked nothing, her kobold army descended upon Mythras and burned it to the ground. From the smoking roots of the Great Tree, her servants extracted the second piece of the Ostium.</p>

            <p><strong>Personality.</strong> Ceranos was careful with her words, she said so herself. She projected confidence and control, wearing her magical necklace like armor against fear and doubt. She seemed genuinely convinced of her own importance, assured that continued service would secure her "place in history."</p>

            <p><strong>Death and Disappearance.</strong> In the three-way battle that followed the destruction of Mythras, she was killed in the fighting. But death is not always the end for those who serve Enkosee.  Her current whereabouts, and what remains of her, are unknown.</p>

            <p><strong>Aftermath.</strong> Bandito claimed her Necklace of Supreme Confidence from her corpse, though he has not spoken of how he came to possess it. The second Ostium fragment she recovered was taken by the party.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Kellar Tegya</h3>
            <p><em>Clockmaker, possible creator of the Fractum Ostium</em></p>

            <p>Kellar Tegya is the legendary artisan who crafted the Fractum Ostium for the original Primus of the Modrons. Their signature appears on the technical diagrams scattered across the planes - instructions for assembling the ancient artifact.</p>

            <p>Little is known of Tegya with certainty. Enkosee, who has lived long enough to remember them, describes the clockmaker as "very, very old, and probably a little mad." He refers to Tegya as "that old goat" and recalls that they were building "some sort of contraption for the Primus."</p>

            <p>What is known is that Tegya was "not from this world", they came from somewhere beyond the planes and possessed power sufficient to craft artifacts that could bend space itself. They are described as "a tad unpredictable" and "very, very powerful."</p>

            <p>Tegya maintained a workshop "squirrelled away in some forsaken place, hidden deep in the Shadowfell." They did not like to be interrupted. The workshop's exact location remains unknown, though research suggests the party may be able to find an address among the technical diagrams.</p>

            <p>No one has seen Kellar Tegya in eons. Whether they still live, where they might be found, and what manner of being they truly are remain mysteries yet to be unraveled.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 1</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Verthandi (Chris Sweitzer)</em></strong>
            <p>
            Verthandi awoke to screaming. It sank into him slowly. Only a few
            voices at first, and then more and more. They varied as well. One
            sounded like the gears of a broken water wheel. Another like a
            disused bugle. He couldn’t see. Some kind of mucus covered his
            eyes.  He also realized he was screaming, although silently into
            the minds of those around him using his telepathy.
            </p>
            <div class="illustration_wide"><img class="illustration_wide" src="img/tunnel_mask.png"></div>
            <p>

            Attempting to bring his own terror under control, he thought back
            to the last moments he could remember. It was like waking up from a
            dream. But it wasn’t just his capture and damnation that started to
            slip away from his memory, but his entire life seemed to receding
            into a haze. Even his name, or rather the name of the previous
            Hierophant that he had supplanted and assumed, barely remained.

            </p>
            <p>
            The screaming had begun to subside. Verthandi also had ceased his
            quiet exclamations, and began to take in his situation. He felt
            weak, both mentally and physically.  And he was physically bound by
            some viscous rope-like that held his arms against his body and
            prevented his legs from moving. Struggling only slid him around
            inside the bindings, slacking them not at all.

            </p>
            <p>
            He used his tentacles to wipe away some of the thick fluid from his
            eyes and took in his situation. He was in long room, fastened to
            one fleshy wall with what appeared to be bloody sinew. On one end
            was a portal that looked like a sphincter, and along with the walls
            gave Verthandi the impression they must have been in the rectum of
            some kind of giant or colossus.  As his vision cleared, he saw
            there were others in the room, unsurprising as the other screams
            had to be coming from somewhere.

            </p>
            <p>
            Across from him, also tied to the living wall, was a creature
            seemingly made of both man and machine, but in a haphazard manner
            with no rhyme or reason for which pieces of flesh were replaced
            with metal, or had he been a mechanical man with flesh inserted?
            Was there a living brain inside that head? Verthandi did not want
            to find out.

            </p>
            <p>
            Glancing up the room towards the disgusting knot of an exit at the
            end, he took in the rest of their motley crew. There was a loxodon
            with its great elephant’s head and trunk.  Verthandi had tried to
            eat a few loxodon’s brains before, but he could never finish the
            meal, and he always felt stuffed afterwards. Too many unforgotten
            memories, he assumed. He wondered if this loxodon’s memory was
            becoming as spotty as his own. Still, he noticed he was hungry. The
            cultists’ brains he had eaten before had not been satiating. The
            minds of fanatics never were.

            </p>
            <p>
            Next was an angel, or maybe better to say what was left of an
            angel. Verthandi had never been to the plane they resided, but this
            one definitely looked worse for wear. She was gaunt and with wounds
            covering her body, and her wings looked as if they had been torn
            from her body. Blood streaked her face, and seemed to be leaking
            from her eyes. She seemed to shrinking into herself, an oddity for
            angel. Verthandi had never eaten a celestial brain, but others had
            told him they tasted bland.

            </p>
            <p>
            After her was a rabbit, or rather one of the bunny-kin. Many of his
            former circle liked to turn into rabbits. Their brains were tasty,
            although the portions were too small for his liking.  This one was
            the size of a human though. He was clearly attempting to slip his
            bonds, but like the rest of them, to no avail. Still, the furry
            creature did appear to be getting further than any of the rest of
            them did.

            </p>
            <p>
            And across from the bunny was a gith. Covered almost completely,
            others might not immediately recognize one of them, but Verthandi
            had seen enough gith slaves to know. This one, however, did not
            appear to have the same emaciated pallor that most had, and his
            clothing was made from bits of machinery and other items. He seemed
            to be staring most intently at the mechanical man.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            At the end of the hall, if one could call it a hall, were two more
            that Verthandi couldn’t really make one. One appeared to be a
            knight of some kind, perhaps even a paladin based on the heraldry
            that covered his armor. The other had the dark look of a drow elf,
            although he seemed to flicker in and out of existence. Staring too
            long at him gave Verthandi a headache.

            </p>
            <p>
            By now some of the group had begun to speak to one another, while
            Verthandi checked over his equipment as best he could while still
            bound. He still had his legendary rainbow flail, although his
            attempt to telepathically link to it failed. Its multicolored hues
            seemed faded and mottled, as if it had been subjected to acid. It
            felt dead to him. His rainbow shield was pitted and chipped,
            although still brighter than the flail, and his leather armor was
            torn, the rainbow patterns becoming streamers that hung limply from
            his body.

            </p>
            <p>
            Finally a voice boomed out from beyond the portal, which was now
            opening, saying “Come forth and present yourselves to me!” The
            bonds loosened and fell away. Verthandi and the others were free,
            and looked at one another, wondering what to do next before finally
            decided to go into the next room to see what was in store for them
            in this strange place.

            </p>
            <p>
            The room they entered into was huge, with a circular platform
            surrounded by what looked like lava. Small ramps led into doors to
            the left and across from where they entered, and standing at the
            door to the left was and old human wearing red priestly-looking
            garb, although Verthandi had his doubts about the godliness of the
            person. Not in this place. Which made him wonder, where were they?
            He felt like he should know, but like so much of his knowledge, it
            seemed to be just beyond his ability to remember.  He glanced at
            the angel, seeing recognization in her face, but before he was able
            to ask her where they were, the man spoke.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Welcome. I don’t think we’re ever had such a diverse group
            before,” said the man.
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/enkosee.png"></div>
            “I am Enkosee. Some of you may have already realized, but you’re in
            hell.” Memories of his last moments flooded back to him. Those
            devil worshippers had somehow managed it. They hadn’t just opened a
            portal and pushed him through. They had damned him. Even if he had
            been able to leave this place, he probably would still be
            intrinsically tied here.  Enkosee went on to explain that they were
            the lucky ones. They weren’t going to be tortured and subjected to
            their worst fears for eternity, but rather, if they so chose, they
            were going to work for the devils doing their bidding, for all
            eternity. It sounded better, but only barely.

            </p>
            <p>
            The paladin, for that’s what he had to be, was having none of this.
            He immediately drew his weapon and attempted to charge the devil’s
            minion, or perhaps he was a devil himself, Verthandi thought. Two
            steps into his charge however, and the paladin was lifted into the
            air. His eyes bulged and his body stiffened, and then exploded into
            pieces. Weirdly enough the various pieces were whole. Verthandi
            could see each organ: heart, lungs, eyeballs, and so on, still in
            one piece. And still alive as well. And out from his skull came his
            brain, which only made Verthandi hungrier. He suspected that if he
            attempted to eat any of the group, he would end up just like the
            paladin, so he quickly suppressed that thought. Then the former
            paladin was unceremoniously dumped into the lava, which upon closer
            inspection turned out not to be lava, but rather a sea of flesh.
            Pieces of beings writhing in pain and supplying some kind of energy
            to the masters of this plane. Verthandi shuddered. Very little
            bothered him, but somehow he had to make sure he did not become
            part of their power source.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            The elephant-headed man started to ask Enkosee a question. A
            loxodon, Verthandi had to struggle to remind himself. Was his
            memory fading still? The loxodon wanted a copy of the rules they
            had to follow. Enkosee thought this was a great idea, and directed
            them to find the Scribery. Pointing them towards the doorway that
            was on the opposite side of the orifice they had emerged from, he
            told them finding these rules would be their first task, and that
            they should find someone by the name of Panulis.

            </p>
            <p>
            Since it appeared they would be stuck together for a while,
            Verthandi introduced himself. The angel went by the name of
            Feuriel. Bandito was the bunny-kin. The gith called himself
            Crokiak, and the loxodon was Aldoon. The man-machine could not seem
            to remember his name, although Crokiak seemed to believe he could
            fix that. The drow did not speak.

            </p>
            <p>
            A strange feeling overcame Verthandi. It was like he was heading
            out for the first time time with a group of like-minded individuals
            on an adventure as he had shortly after joining the druidic circle
            so many years ago. Although whether it was his memory or the
            memories of his companions who’s brains he had eaten on that first
            trip, the circle was not happy when they found out he was the only
            survivor of a kobold attack, Verthandi did not know. Either way,
            there was a refreshing upbeat feeling among the group, which lasted
            as long as it took for them to get through the door and into an
            unending corridor that ran off to the left and right of the door
            for as far as they could. Hundreds, if not thousands of creatures
            walked along it’s reddish brick, which had been worn smooth over
            the millennia. There were devils, imps, and other hellish creatures
            traveling this enclosed road, and a variety of other doors and
            buildings were along it. He still felt they were out of place.

            </p>
            <p>
            Some of the group started heading off to the left, but not wanting
            to wander this land for eternity, Verthandi went back to his
            original method that he used to get into the druidic circle. He
            grabbed a random devil, and sending his magical energy though the
            brightly, abet faded, painted druidic focus, which was a unicorn
            riding a rainbow, charmed the devil.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Tell me where the scribery is,” he demanded.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Oh, it’s you Bob.” The devil seemed to recognized Verthandi.
            Victims of the charming spell always seemed to think he was someone
            he wasn’t. “Good to see you again! The scribery? Why would you want
            to go there?”

            </p>
            <p>
            “We need to find it.”

            </p>
            <p>
            “Well you’re going in the wrong direction. It’s about five hours
            travel that way,” he said, pointing back down the corridor. “I
            could take you there. We could catch up. It’s been a few centuries
            since we say each other.”

            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi didn’t want to be around when the spell wore off. Humans
            were touchy enough about having magic used upon their minds. He
            didn’t think devils would be any less irksome about it. “No, I’ll
            get in touch with you later. Thank for you the help.”

            </p>
            <p>
            And so the group turned around, and started to walk. Silence
            permeated their travel, apart from an occasional comment or
            muttered remark. None of them had a way to tell how long they had
            been walking for, except for maybe the mechanically-inclined
            Crokiak or the mechanically-included...whatever his name used to
            be. Verthandi again wondered if there was a brain inside that
            skull, and whether he could figure out his name if he consumed it.
            After what could have been five hours, or five hundred, they
            arrived outside the Scribery. Two hellish looking guards stood
            blocking the entrance. Verthandi thought about using another spell
            to charm one of the guards, but he only had one left and there were
            two of them.

            </p>
            <p>
            “We have been sent by Enkosee to find Panulis,” said Feuriel. “Let
            us pass.”

            </p>
            <p>
            “Piss off,” was the response given by one of the guards, who kept
            eyeing a stash of loot that sat nearby.

            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/lesser_bearded_devils.png"></div>
            <p>
            “They must want a bribe,” said Aldoon. “But where are we going to
            find something to give them?” The rabbit-eared Bandito smiled and
            said, “I’ll just grab something from their own pile.” He and
            Crokiak began to confer, speaking of the best way to distract the
            two guards and grab what they needed, but it seemed impossible even
            for the two together. Verthandi suspected they were suffering from
            he same diminished capability he was.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            Feuriel finally seem to grow tired of waiting and drew up to her
            full height and demanded that the guards allow them to enter,
            towering over them even though she was physically shorter.
            Verthandi thought he could see her angelic wings for a second, but
            then they were gone again. Unfortunately, devils, even their
            guards, aren’t too impressed by celestial posturing. But then the
            metallic man pulled one of the guards aside and spoke to him in
            even more threatening tones. Whatever he did, it worked as one of
            the guards seemed to crumple against the other, and they began to
            speak in low tones. Finally they capitulated and let the group into
            the Scribery. Verthandi was thankful that they didn’t have to fight
            the guards, as he still wasn’t sure if that would be considered
            against the rules and get them all killed.

            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/scribery.png"></div>
            <p>
            The inside of the Scribery was gigantic. Rows of tables and shelf
            after shelf of bookcases lined the room. Sitting at the tables were
            hundreds of small creatures. They looked like gnomes, but twisted.
            All of them were writing furiously on pieces of parchment.
            Verthandi sighed. Clearly Enkosee was testing them, but they didn’t
            have much choice in the matter. At least not yet. He walked over to
            a surprisingly comfy chair, picked up a throw pillow that had all
            the stuffing bunched up in one end and sat down. The others started
            questioning some of the gnomes while Feuriel and the mechanical man
            started looking at the bookshelves.  One of these creatures had to
            at least know where Panulis was, thought Verthandi. And so one by
            one he started touching each mind sending the name “Panulis” to
            each. By luck, one of the gnomes who’s skin looked a bit more
            reddish than the others looked up and said

            </p>
            <p>
            “Who is calling me?”

            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/failed_imp.png"></div>
            <p>
            Aldoon walked over to Panulis and said, “We were sent by Enkosee
            for the rules of hell.” Panulis responded with “Of course, I’ll get
            you a copy,” but made no effort or attempt to stop his scribbling.
            When it became obvious that no progress was going to be made,
            Aldoon and Bandito pulled the paper out from under his pen. Then
            from above came an imp, and started scratching at Panulis, no doubt
            because he had stopped his incessant writing. Looking up, Verthandi
            saw there were many of the imps in the rafters above. They must be
            there to make sure the gnomes continuing their seemingly pointless
            work.

            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel, again tiring of the delay, then pulled out a javelin and
            threw it straight through the imp’s shoulder, and things started to
            get more interesting.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 2</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Bandito (Chris Johnson)</em></strong>
            <p>
            <em>But surely she would have known this would happen if she
                attacked them...how could she not?!  She must be very powerful
                to have had that kind of bravery. Or perhaps very stupid. But
                she’s an Angel ... sort of ... well, I can’t let her die,
                Enkosee seemed to think we were all important in some
                way...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>*thwip* *SPLUT*</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito loosed his crossbow and the bolt was perfectly true, his
            indecision turned to decision to join the fray defending the fallen
            angel. The bolt pierced straight through the back of the imp’s
            neck, and out his mouth. YESSS! The body of the small imp exploded
            in grotesque and poisonous gas and green intestines, splattering
            again all over Feuriel. NOOOO!  Bandito’s inner monologue
            confounded by the great shot followed by further misery the poor
            Feuriel encountered after this ugly creature’s death!
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>I wonder if I can hide under the table from that, that looks
                disgusting!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            After his bolt killed that imp, Bandito sees one flee. Bandito
            smiles, and giggles ... he always did enjoy when his precision and
            surprise attacks had the consequential benefit of fear against
            those who were fighting against him. But then a stone flies in
            front of Bandito, striking the fleeing imp, and it explodes
            violently. Bandito flinches, but thankful another one of those
            beasts are dead.

            </p>
            <p>
            <em>What’s with all those moving books?! Looks like some are on the
                ground and some are going back up on the shelves?! What
                the...</em>Bandito observes the unseen servant’s behaviors and
            the seemingly confusing actions of the man-machine, but then sees
            him point and say “NNOOO” and some strange light shoots out of his
            finger and hits an imp, who is clearly both surprised and
            infuriated.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>What is Aldoon chanting or praying about? I mean he’s slow and
                in a moment of action, just standing there praying?! ... I
                can’t believe Enkosee picked this priest to help... I was
                hoping he’d be more help... I need to find some cover and hide
                before things get ugly!</em>
            Bandito dips in underneath the table, disappearing from anyone’s
            sight....JUST in time to see another bolt of energy flash above the
            table, and oh no! The splash of the imp guts all over the floor and
            back up into his face! <em>Oh no, this is horrible!? How did Feuriel
                get hit with this so many times!?  BLEAAUUUAHHHH! Good gawd, I
                can’t stopppp! What’s going on up thhhh...heeuaahhhh!!!</em>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/failed_imp2.png"></div>
            Bandito vomits violently from the consequential splash as the imp
            explodes his poisonous insides all over the floor and the splash
            consequently on Bandito. Obviously Feuriel takes the brunt of the
            splash, though she’s already covered and heaving, but even Bandito
            gets violently sick with this one.
            </p>
            <p>
            As the feeling begins to subside, he hears some cheers and
            conversation from above the table, but his head is still
            pounding... the taste of vomit fresh in his mouth, he really has no
            idea what’s going on up there.... Bandito pulls out his waterskin
            from his pack. Taking a big mouthful of water, swishing it all
            around his mouth and spitting it in on the floor, then a second big
            gulp and swallowing this one. <em>Feuriel must feel horrible if this is
            how I feel! I should give her some water, I’m sure she could use
            that...</em>Bandito creeps out from under the table, looking around, and
            sees the imps nowhere to be seen, there seems to be some focus
            around Panulis, who seems to have taken something out and given it
            to Crokiak...”Feuriel, my dear, you probably want some of this..”
            and Bandito extends his waterskin to the struggling Feuriel. She
            seems interested in the exchange going on above the table, but
            she’s still on her knees, working to get up.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Yes, thank you, little one” she says.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/book_of_rules.png"></div>
            <p>
            <em>So this is the famous book of rules - doesn’t seem to impressive to
                me...</em>Bandito grasps what the conversation is all about - a book
            that seems to bite back given the bloody fingers several
            surrounding the book have gotten.  <em>Well, that seems certainly
            appropriate, the law book is painful to read ...  seems like every
            stinking law I’ve learned of. Never given me anything of value -
            just nothing but pain - just like the rest of this godforsaken
            place....</em>Bandito’s mind pauses, his eyes go to the fallen angel ...
        his lips curl in a smirk. <em>Well.... I suppose it is ...
            god...forsaken... I wonder what she did to get here ... seems like
            it couldn’t be good... I’ll need to remember not to cross her, stay
            on her good side....glad I offered her some water after all.</em>
            Bandito’s perspective on Feuriel shifts from feeling sorry for her
            to feeling lucky he’s begun to be on her good side.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Are they seriously going to read this whole stupid book here?! We
            need to get out of here...  those imps are coming back with
            reinforcements!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito steps up to the table, and clears his throat to try and get
            the big people’s attention.  *AHEM* “I don’t know what you all are
            planning, but we should be leaving this place...there are always
            consequences...” he says, his voice trailing off ... as he
            suspiciously looks around as the final book goes back on the shelf,
            and a broom, mop, and bucket begin moving around the room cleaning
            up the remains of the imps... <em>well I haven’t seen this before, but
            I suppose this is a good idea - getting the remains of those awful
            things gone is really important for us to get out of here
            unscathed.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Paulis responds to Bandito, “Yes, right! Well there are two options
            to getting to Uman Yango now that you have the book of rules - the
            long way or the *ahem* short cut, which, well ... isn’t entirely
            allowed for me to bring you that way, but you seem like proper
            folks who could use a little rest and as long as you don’t tell
            Enkosee, we could go that way...”
            </p>
            <p>

            Bandito quickly responds, excited about the prospect of a short cut
            after this debacle... “That would be wonderful - do tell where do
            we ... “
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito is interrupted by Crokiak and then Feuriel “We should
            really take the appropriate way, and not try and take short cuts or
            break the rules” Aldoon saying “I’m good for a walk....” and
            everyone overruling Bandito without a second thought, he rolls his
            eyes and looks frustratingly at Panulis, who also seems a bit
            disappointed, looking around and gathering a few items. <em>Isn’t this
            just like the tall people...always not even taking us smaller ones
            into account. Like who put them in charge?! Such rule followers ...
            which, honestly ... could they even find the stupid rule that says
            that we can’t take the short cut ... the dumb rules are irrelevant
            as long as we don’t get caught ... and CLEARLY Panulis knows how to
            not get caught... but nope ... they don’t want to listen to him
            either ... whatever ... they’re big. I was outnumbered ... time to
            learn more about this place from Panulis, I’ve now got time for
            that...</em>He rolls his eyes, and heads out, trying to help Panulis
            through the traffic in the streets, but he clearly knows his way
            along...telling Bandito “Yes, yes, I know, I know ... no need to
            point that out to me- I know where I’m going and how to get through
            all this..”
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito looks back at the others, and sees several of them huddled
            around the book, which is floating along in front of them while
            they walk. <em>What a spectacle - always the tall people TRYING to draw
                attention to themselves.</em> He rolls his eyes. Curiously, no one seems
            to be stopping them, though there are a lot of strange stares...
            but there’s no interjecting. One devil talking to another devil,
            pointing it out, but then turning away and minding their own
            business once they see it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>They look so ridiculous, fretting over the rules of this place. I
            just need to get close to Enkosee, he’s my “get out of jail free”
            card - I mean it never matters what the rules are, tall people
            always change them anyhow...but once I have earned value by the
            boss - that’s my opportunity! I hope I get to prove myself here...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Little did he know that was just what was in store for him...

            <p>
            The conversation with Panulis was scintillating, and it surely
            seems to be exactly as he expected it would be - they talk a lot
            about “rules”, and how much they’re talked about here, and SEEM
            important, but the random assortment of rules are always used to
            the advantage of the bosses and if they don’t have a rule that
            suits them, they just make another one. The more he learned about
            it, Hell was just like Xanathar’s gang ... the strong survive. They
            always do.  Once again, Bandito curses the weak body he was born to
            ... frail and weak. But he’s been successful so far using his
            quickness and his wit - hoping that will work here too. <em>So right
            now - Enkosee’s the strongest I’ve seen down here ... lets see what
            we can do to find a way to show him value...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            They seem to slow down, and appear into another large stone door,
            and Panulis indicates we are here, telling them all to be on their
            best behavior.
            </p>
            <p>

            They walk into a massive cavern, and there’s ... <em>What the HELL is
                that thing!? </em>Bandito stops dead in his tracks. Bandito sees a large
            devil with red wings and body that he’s never seen anything like,
            but curiously it is not taking any actions toward them. Its then
            that he spots several others in the room, including Enkosee. There
            seems to be some kind of ritual circle, and Enkosee is barking out
            orders to others in robes. <em>There he is, we will finally get to
                prove our value.</em>
            </p>
            <p>

            As the group approaches Enkosee, he’s pleased to see them, and
            welcomes them. Bandito’s demeanor immediately brightens when he
            mentions Waterdeep. <em>This is great - I know RIGHT where Jarnsen’s is
            - that old man gave me bit of bread and kept me alive some days
            when I was a wee kitten - lost in a world of tall people, and
            trying to find my way. Just any piece of kindness was welcomed by
            Bandito in those days as the daylight in his dreary night of
            existence.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Enkosee completes his description of the “job” they have,
            describing Jarnsen, handing the scrolls to the broken man-machine
            that they are expected to convince the old man Jarnsen to sign the
            contract of his own volition, and then they would teleport back.
            Sounds simple enough.  Bandito smiled at the way Enkosee described
            a man of “irrelevance” they would encounter when they went through
            the portal... <em>surely if Enkosee thinks of some tall people as
            inconsequential, and is giving me this task, he must think highly
            of me - this is great!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            And as the massive beast holds open the portal apparently
            struggling to not go through himself, and the men in robes
            commanded by Enkosee all chant in unison, Enkosee calmly tells us
            to go on through the portal and prove ourselves of value to him.
            Bandito leaps through first, ready to do just that...
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito sees Manfred, the “inconsequential” wizard described by
            Enkosee’s eyes widen as he comes through the portal - clearly not
            what he had expected, and then as the remainder of our motley crew
            passes through, and the portal closes, waves of confusion and fear
            as he re-reads his scrolls and re-mouths the words he was saying.
            “Who are you, I don’t understand” he says...really to no one in
            particular.
            </p>
            <p>
            As Verdandi exits the circle we originated in and heads for the
            door, Bandito moves forward to district and help to confuse the
            Wizard, approaching him, and wandering around him, asking him
            questions, and telling him wild stories about where he’s just been,
            but in such ways that the Wizard is not so much intrigued as
            confused and uncertain of his own abilities any longer.  Meanwhile,
            Bandito does as he’s done for years, and easily swipes some keys, a
            gem, and gold from the wizards’ robes. <em>Well that was easier than I
                thought... </em>he chuckles to himself and walks toward and out the
            door, thanking Manfred for his hospitality, and hoping him great
            success.

            </p>
            <p>
            As they exit that room, they are in a hallway, and Bandito quickly
            realizes by looking through the windows that its not quite dark
            enough to bring this band of freaks straight through Waterdeep. <em>I
            mean, Waterdeep has plenty of weirdo’s - but this particular group
            will stand out far too much, never mind a mind flayer walking
            straight through town would most CERTAINLY bring in the guard. I
            mean maybe with one or two of these odd character’s we could grease
            certain guards to look the other way, but there’s really no chance
            of anything good happening with us roaming straight through the
            city, so I’ll need to help them get better disguised and we need to
            wait a bit to do this under the cover of darkness. There’s a great
            many eyes and ears in Waterdeep...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            So Bandito leads the group out the back door to Manfred’s lovely
            home. He finds what appears to be a shed or garage of some kind,
            and encourages everyone to get inside and get disguised, as he puts
            on his own hat, bringing his ears back to be a bit more subtle as
            he always did.  There were many questions about why they would need
            to be disguised, and why they should listen to the rabbit, at which
            point he emphatically says, “This is where I’m from - I KNOW this
            place! I know it WELL. Trust me. We don’t want to just walk through
            the streets, people will call the guard, and it will be far more
            complicated than need be.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel chimes in, “Wait, you’re ACTUALLY FROM here?!”
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito, with a deadpan look on his face, “yes, that’s what I said.
            Now lets get changed!”
            </p>
            <p>
            And the group demeanor seemed to shift ever so slightly. <em>Maybe they
            could listen to us small people. Time will tell - but at least
            they’re listening...for now...</em>
            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            He spent extra time helping the Mind flayer disguise himself, and
            thankfully his outfit looked proper. Everyone had some version of
            disguise, which should help as we navigate through the streets.
            </p>
            <p>
            As night fell, and the party completed their disguises, Bandito
            walks the streets nearby, checking that the coast is clear, and
            they can depart. He returns to the room where the party is, and
            says “Are we ready - the coast is clear to exit...follow me
            carefully, and we should be able to get there without too much
            trouble along the way...” and the group files out of garage, headed
            down a dark alley after the rabbit man. As they dip in and out of
            dark alleys, Bandito tracking them through less populated parts of
            the city. It was not exactly a direct route, but he knew these
            streets, and needed to take the less populated routes - not
            everyone was disguised perfectly ...  and he didn't want to get
            caught.
            </p>
            <p>
            As they were transitioning from one dark alley to another, he knew
            they had to go by a popular bar, but hoped that they would pass
            uneventfully, but Crokiak was spotted... as Bandito turned to look
            that everyone made it from the next alleyway, he sees a small group
            of revelers that piled out of the bar talking with Crokiak. <em>Oh boy,
                this can’t be good.</em> Bandito says to himself, but almost as soon as
            the conversation began with Crokiak, the conversation was over, and
            they were moving on. Somehow, Crokiak may have had some kind of
            power over the drunks to

            leave them alone - they initially seemed like they were going to be
            trouble, but off they went, happy as ever!
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito knew they were almost there, and he led the group through
            nearly the final alleyway, but then someone tripped over the
            homeless man who was sleeping in the alley. He complained, but then
            rolled over in his box, and went back to sleep, thankfully. Darting
            a look at the remainder of the group, he said “We’re almost there,
            don’t screw it up now!” and off he went...
            </p>
            <p>
            They initially approached Jarnsen’s from across the street. Bandito
            turns to the others and says, “there’s a rear entrance, if I
            remember, and since its closed, I can go investigate things more
            closely while you all gather across the street behind the store.
            Meet you there in a few minutes!” And away he slips into the
            darkness. He spends time “casing the job” and sees old man Jarnsen
            inside reading a scroll. He notices the window and door entrances,
            observing one of the entrances seems to require you to walk across
            what may be a creaky set of steps, while the other one has stone
            steps, so as he’s formulating a plan to entry and engagement, he
            sees Crokiak boldly just walking up to the creaky steps, and
            banging on the door. <em>What the...I thought we were going to come up
            with a plan!? Well, I guess not ... these guys just strolling right
            up there... *hrumph* ugh, tall people.</em> Bandito rolls his eyes
            again, and slips in the back entrance silently while the rest go in
            through the other entrance. Curiously and a bit unexpectedly, the
            old man welcomes the strange group into his shop. He observes
            Crokiak and the broken man-machine’s engagement with Jarnsen, “We.
            HAVE. What...you’re...looking for...you just... need to ... sign
            this” as the broken man breaks the scroll seal and unfurls and
            hands the contract to Jarnsen.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel says, her arms folded, “I wouldn’t sign that if I were
            you.” Jarnsen raises his eyebrow, and as the Broken Man reaffirms
            his statement, Jarnsen raises his glass and focuses in on the paper
            put in front of him.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Mind Flayer quietly saunters to the door to the main store,
            seemingly checking to make sure no one else is here. <em>I sure hope
                he’s not planning to eat this Jarnsen’s brain...</em> Bandito watches
            Verdandi cautiously, hopeful that wasn’t his plan, but honestly,
            not sure what he’d do about it if it were ... he remains unsettled
            by the Mind Flayer ... but so far, he’s been largely supportive of
            our group’s success - so he wonders whether he’ll ever get
            comfortable with Verdandi...
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito’s attention shifts back to the center of the room.
            Crokiak’s eyes seem to be darting around the room at all the books,
            and begins to focus in on the scroll Jarnsen was reading when they
            arrived. “What’s that” he asks Jarnsen, as he’s beginning to read
            the contract and pointing at the scroll left on the table he was
            sitting at.
            </p>
            <p>
            Leaving the contract he was reading, Jarnsen quickly engages the
            Githzerai excitedly, “Oh that, its a new piece I just received in,
            and was trying to understand it - it seems like some kind of
            instruction, but I can’t read any of it beyond the pictures...”
            </p>
            <p>

            “Oh, that? Its Modron - I know that and could help you translate it
            once you sign the contract.”, Crokiak volunteers. Jarnsen looks
            back at the contract warily. At this point, Bandito takes the
            opportunity to lean in, using his most peaceful demeanor, those
            rosy pink bunny eyes, and his wriggling nose, looking up at
            Jarnsen, and says, “Yes, I remember when I was a wee kitten, you
            used to offer me scraps of bread and food from your shop when I was
            the most desperate. If you were able to help me when I was in such
            need, I’m sure we can help you - we just need you to sign the
            contract so we can work together to help each other...” Jarnsen
            looks at the harengon, pats him on the head, and his kind eyes look
            back at the contract scroll, pick up the quill, and he says, “well,
            I haven’t gotten all the way through it, but if someone has sent
            you to help me, and this is the way to it, then I’m certain signing
            this will be the best course of action...” and signs the contract.
            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/jarnson.png"></div>
            <p>
            Jarnsen then puts down his glass, and turns his attention to
            Crokiak, “Interesting, I was just saying to myself, ‘God, I wish
            someone would come help me figure out what in the world this said’”
            The looks between the party members, especially Feuriel are telling
            to Bandito - but luckily Jarnsen seems enthralled suddenly in the
            idea that Crokiak was purposely sent here to help him with the
            translation...he also sees Crokiak begin to scrutinize the back of
            the scroll and then the broken man joins in the curiosity, and
            begins even writing down what he’s seeing on the scroll. Jarnsen is
            suddenly alarmed, “Oh no, you cannot copy that here, that’s not
            allowed in my shop at all!” Crokiak then says, “Fine, how much
            would you sell this for.” As he looks up from his writing, sliding
            the page over to The Broken Man to continue the work, while he
            engaged with Jarnsen.
            </p>
            <p>
            Jarnsen pulls on his beard a bit, looking up at the ceiling,
            clearly a bit uncertain, but senses the opportunity. “Well, I’m not
            sure - I’ve just now gotten it, but it appears to be valuable
            instructions to something powerful. Without really knowing, I’d
            happily sell this to you for 500 gold.” Crokiak chuckles under his
            breath, and before he can respond, Bandito, sensing the moment,
            intercedes, and diverts Jarnsen’s attention, excitedly saying,
            “Wow, pages like that can go for that much money!? I can’t even
            imagine that?! So incredible! Tell me more!”
            </p>
            <p>
            Jarnsen, with the small Harengon’s sudden excited interest, tells
            him, “Why yes, its quite a business - we have a great many valuable
            tomes and archives!” At this point, Bandito begins pointing out
            different seemingly important books to try and get him engaged in
            each tome, telling him about them and their value, hopefully giving
            time to Crokiak and the Broken Man to copy down whatever they
            needed to without Jarnsen’s wary eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
            As he’s listening idly to Jarnsen praddle on about some ancient
            tome, he sees Feuriel’s impatient side again, and she storms over
            to Crokiak, and he vaguely hears her demand “Are we really going to
            fool around with those old man, we’ve already damned him to a
            lifetime of eternal damnation, we should just take the thing and be
            done with this, lets get on with it!” Bandito’s eyes quickly flit
            back to Jarnsen, worried he had heard this damning statement, and
            wondered if there would be trouble. Thankfully - Jarnsen was deep
            in a dusty old tome, and Bandito feigned interest as the old man
            looked up at him just as he was telling him about the value of the
            book. <em>I think its about the leave this place before we wind up
            having more trouble
            than I can get us out of...</em> And Bandito sees The Broken Man, just
            finishing up his drawing, Crokiak goes to take the original
            article, and the Broken Man reaches his hand out, looking sternly
            at the Githzerai, and tells him “No, we have our copy, this one is
            his....” Bandito keeps Jarnsen engaged by pointing something out in
            the book, hoping like crazy that this doesn’t blow up...
            </p>
            <p>
            Crokiak stares directly into the glowing eyes of The Broken Man,
            and it seems like minutes to Bandito, as he watches the exchange
            over the old man’s shoulder ... <em>Please, PLEASE don’t make a scene
            right now - we’re almost done with this quest! Enkosee will see our
            value if you don’t screw this up!</em> And after Crokiak’s eyes go from
            The Broken Man to the two copies, and he assesses the value of the
            copy is near identical to the original, he withdraws his hand from
            the original, and nods solemnly to The Broken Man, the tension
            seemingly easing... <em>Whew!  That seemed close.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            And with that, Bandito hugs the old man, thanks him for his
            incredible tour of the store, and as he does so, he drops the gem
            from the wizard in one of the old man’s pockets. <em>Sure seems you’ll
                need this more than me, old man - good luck.</em> Bandito’s fleeting
            guilt paid him no mind as he compensated the eternity of misery
            he’s cursed this man to ...
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 3</h3>
            <strong><em>from the perspective of The Broken Man (DM notes edition)</em></strong>
            <p>
            The Broken Man felt the portal collapse behind them with a familiar "fwoop" - the smell of sulphur and burnt hair lingering in the air. They had returned to Uman Yango. The pit fiend and wizards were gone. Enkosee stood waiting, with Panulis at his side.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Ah, you made it back," Enkosee said. "How did it go?"
            </p>
            <p>
            The party reported their success - the bookseller had signed the contract of his own free will. Enkosee seemed pleased. "Excellent, excellent. You didn't have any trouble on the way? Well, you certainly have exceeded my expectations, low as they were. Perhaps you will prove to be of use to me in more... consequential tasks."
            </p>
            <p>
            He asked if they had found anything else of interest. The Broken Man thought of the scroll they had copied in Jarnsen's shop - the one with the strange coordinates and diagrams. The party had kept the copy, returning only the original. For now, that knowledge remained theirs alone.

            "Succeed, and you will find me most generous," Enkosee said, and rewarded them with gold. He granted them downtime to rest and recover. "You may visit the bazaar, rest, or return to the Scribery. I am quite the collector of rare arcanum. Earn my good faith and someday I might allow you to view my collection."

            The Broken Man chose to spend his time in the archives with Panulis. The twisted gnome knew things - useful things - about how Hell operated. More importantly, he knew how to navigate its systems without attracting unwanted attention.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Book of Rules revealed new secrets to those who studied it carefully. The Broken Man discovered that by deliberately providing the book with a blood sacrifice, one could gain advantage when searching for specific regulations. The book could also be persuaded to change its language, translating its contents into any tongue the reader knew. A useful property.
            </p>
            <p>
            Panulis offered more than just access to documents. He claimed to have "some influence" with Enkosee - the ability to arrange things for a price. A favor, unspecified, to be called upon in the future. The Broken Man noted this offer but did not accept it. Not yet. Such bargains had a way of costing more than expected.
            </p>
            <p>
            "You don't stay out of trouble as long as I have without knowing a few tricks," Panulis had said. The Broken Man suspected those tricks included knowing when not to make deals.

            <p>
            The others had scattered to pursue their own interests. Bandito visited the bazaar - a chaotic market where slaves, beasts, weapons, armor, potions, and less savory commodities changed hands. The Harengon moved through the crowds with practiced ease, acquiring items through purchase and other means.
            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi, the illithid, seemed most interested in the food stalls - though "food" was perhaps a generous term for what passed as sustenance in Hell. The Broken Man did not inquire further.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel kept to herself, her expression unreadable. Whatever thoughts occupied the fallen angel, she did not share them.
            </p>
            <p>
            They rested. In Hell, rest was never truly restful - but it was necessary. The Broken Man used the time to study, to process, to understand the rules that governed their new existence.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            After they had rested, Enkosee summoned them again. He had a new task - an opportunity to prove themselves in "a greater context."
            </p>
            <p>
            "As before, you will find yourselves transported to a place where there will be a group in need of a service," Enkosee explained. "Unlike the first idiot, these ones will be more insistent. You can choose to help them or not - it's inconsequential to me. What I want is for you to retrieve something for me."
            </p>
            <p>
            He spoke of a treasure cache from some long-dead lich. Most of it had been plundered, but written records remained - and those were what Enkosee desired. "Retrieve any written records you find and bring them back to me. The rest you can keep. Kill them. Bribe them. Treat with them. I care not about how you get results, just that you get them."
            </p>
            <p>
            "The place is called Pelion. I've never been there myself but I hear it's a dreadful place. Best to get in and out as quickly as possible."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            The portal deposited them in a barren landscape. Two figures waited - a wizard in black robes and a gruff fighter in chain armor. The wizard stepped forward with theatrical grandeur.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Hail to you, spawn of hell! We seek your aid!"
            </p>
            <p>
            The fighter rolled his eyes. "Gerath, what the hell is this? They don't look like any devil spawn I've ever heard of."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Shut up, Karl," the wizard snapped. "The spell worked, didn't it? I read the damn scroll, a portal opened up, and something came through from the other side."
            </p>
            <p>
            Karl surveyed the party with growing disbelief. "One of them's a bloody rabbit! And an elephant! And some sort of squid man. He's green! Did you open a portal to hell, or to a circus menagerie?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Shut up!"
            </p>
            <p>
            "I am Gerath Spellforger," the wizard announced, ignoring his companion, "and this is Karl the Luskan Bastard." The mercenary shrugged and nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gerath launched into a pompous speech about fulfilling their duty, but Karl cut him off. "Cut the theatrics, Gerath. Look, all you have to do is go in there, kill everything there, and come back here and let us know. Job done, we all get on with our day. Okay?" He gestured toward a cave with a staircase leading down into darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Broken Man studied the two men carefully. They sought a small jeweled flask, they said. They had obtained the summoning scroll from a traveling bard. They had entered this place before and been driven back by undead. A third companion - Tannis - had fallen to an arrow and then had his head gouged out by a skeleton.
            </p>
            <p>
            There was more to their story. The Broken Man could sense it. But for now, the task was clear: descend into the dungeon, retrieve any written records, and survive.
            </p>
            <p>
            The party descended the stairs into darkness.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 4 - In The Dungeons of Garg</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Aldoon (Steve Graham)</em></strong>
            <p>
            Aldoon was standing in the ancient hall, his shield aglow from his
            light spell, his warhammer gripped tightly in his fist, listening
            to the sounds of more skeletons, and other things, approaching. For
            the first time in a very long while he knew what he was supposed to
            do.
            </p>
            <p>
            As he descended into this place, he was welcomed by the familiar
            musty, dank aroma of an ancient ruin. As the first skeletons
            appeared, he noted the bright, acrid stench of long-rotted flesh
            and bones. And he felt at home. Or at least more at home than he
            had felt in what seemed like thousands of years.
            </p>
            <p>
            The mountains surrounding Aldoon’s home city of Erridon held many
            secrets, and sometimes those secrets roused. As the patrols charged
            with protecting the mountain passes, Aldoon’s order were also sent
            to investigate disturbances in the ancient temples and caverns.
            Aldoon knew these foes, and his training returned to him swiftly,
            the incantations for turning back these creatures already on his
            lips. His trunk curled around the wooden symbol of The Sister,
            Iolensis - the one he had carved with his fingers in hell’s
            darkness. He felt the faint crackle and hum of her presence.
            </p>
            <p>
            The group was already investigating the passages leading out of the
            hall. Aldoon waited for a moment to decide where he might be
            needed. It did not take long.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Here.” said Crokiak, the green-skinned one - the one who loves
            diagrams and fixing things. He hurled some sort of magic stone at
            something down the hall straight ahead, and Aldoon heard the sounds
            of bones shattering and hitting the stone floor. Next to him, the
            mind flayer, suddenly transformed into some sort of spidery
            creature and disappeared into the darkness above.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aldoon would have strode forward to help, but to his right he heard
            more commotion. In the darkness, he heard arrows flying, and a
            sound not quite like an arrow piercing plate armor - at once
            metallic and meaty. The broken man let out a sound like a man
            getting punched in the stomach, but somehow both raspy and echoey.
            Aldoon began running.
            </p>
            <p>
            In Lododon society, there are many institutions that govern life:
            Family of course, Clan as well.  The ruling Council, one’s
            religious order, and for Aldoon, his patrol, or his ‘March’. The
            March
            brought together Loxoda from all strata of society, and while he
            did not agree with all of their ideas, was not familiar with the
            customs of their Clans, he watched out for them like family. The
            proverb “Clan is Strength, Clan is Safety, Clan is Life” extends to
            all Loxodon institutions, and Aldoon found perhaps his strongest
            bond with his March.
            </p>
            <p>
            Well, for better or worse, and as confusing as all of it was,
            Aldoon had a new March. He ran to the member in trouble, through
            the archway, into the side passage.
            </p>
            <p>
            Highlighted by the rabbit-man’s lantern, Aldoon saw the Broken Man
            pull the arrow the rest of the way through himself (it didn’t take
            much) and look down at it wonderingly. A pool of black liquid that
            might have been his blood gathered at his feet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aldoon skid to a stop next to him, placed his hand on the wound,
            and curled his trunk even tighter around his holy symbol. He
            recited in a rush “By the grace of The Allmother and the Three
            Sisters, restore this man and cure his wounds!”
            </p>
            <p>
            Aldoon had time to wonder “Can the Gods even hear my prayers on
            this strange, dry plane?” but then he felt divine warmth flood
            through him, and saw a slight crackle of energy as the Broken Man’s
            wound closed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Shapes approached from the darkness, the rattle of bones and
            shuffle of rotting flesh echoing through the chamber. Aldoon
            thought he heard the Rabbit man fire an arrow from the shadows, and
            then the creatures were upon them. Aldoon stood and tried to bring
            his shield to bear, lighting the abominations with its glow.
            </p>
            <p>
            From the main chamber, Aldoon heard a roar from the Sundered Angel,
            the crash and xylophone crumble of a shattered skeleton. More were
            coming from that direction. He stepped forward, as the Broken Man
            dodged behind him back to the archway. He swung hard with his
            warhammer, and heard the crunch of the zombie’s shoulder, but the
            thing turned and still scratched and clawed. The rabbit man fended
            off a skeleton with his rapier, keeping it at bay and prying ribs
            free. He thought better of the encounter, and in a flash, leaped
            clear over Aldoon’s head to the cover of the Archway shadows.
            </p>
            <p>
            From the main chamber, Aldoon heard Furiel cry “To the passageway!
            We mustn’t get divided!” He heard her coming to their aid.
            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/zombies_mask2.png"></div>
            <p>
            The Zombie lurched against Aldoon’s shield, but he managed to push
            it back and gain some space to maneuver. “Eorthrakk!” shouted the
            Broken Man from behind him and a crackling green and violet stream
            of energy blasted past Aldoon, carving away half the dead man’s
            face and most of his left shoulder. The zombie tumbled to the stone
            floor.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Sundered Angel was there then, her sword suddenly alight in
            flames. With a scream that might have been anger or delight, she
            swept the weapon down in a diagonal arc that shattered another
            skeleton and scattered its now-burning bones.
            </p>
            <p>
            From the main chamber there came a tremendous ear-splitting boom,
            and the gutteral sound of dying zombies, the skitter of shattered
            skeleton. Aldoon turned back to put his shield between the coming
            attackers and those in the passageway. He saw the Sundered Angel
            head further down the hall, but felt she likely could handle her
            own affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
            As he entered the main chamber again, he saw a dead man approaching
            the Quiet Drow, who was either dazed or unconcerned. Aldoon gripped
            his talisman, pointed with his warhammer and called out “May
            Iolensis cleanse you in her sacred fire.” And it was then that he
            felt the connection with his holy patroness falter.
            </p>
            <p>
            A thin light manifested and pierced down upon the zombie, and yes,
            it seemed the creature was injured, but it was not slowed at all.
            The energy and warmth Aldoon had felt when restoring the Broken Man
            - that was gone now. He felt only a tenuous connection. It was as
            if for some reason The Sister did not want him to harm the
            creature.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Broken Man’s God had no such qualms, apparently, for the next
            moment another green and violet streak took the top of the
            creature’s skull. It crumpled slowly to the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
            A raspy voice suddenly echoed through the chamber: “Stop. the.
            Killing.” </p>
            <p>
            A ruse? A distraction from someone controlling these things? Aldoon
            stood his ground as a dead man and a skeleton bore down on him, but
            then... slowed? He gripped his warhammer tightly, looked over his
            shield into the glassy, unfocused eyes of the zombie.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Stop. the. Killing.” again the voice filled the chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
            And Aldoon noticed the creatures all slowed to a stop - absently
            lowered their claws and weapons. He was dumbstruck.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next couple of minutes were a blur as a thousand thoughts raced
            through his mind. He had thought he finally knew at least a piece
            of what his purpose might be. He thought he finally had some idea
            of what his Goddess wanted of him - of why she would have let these
            things befall him. His training had been thorough in the lore of
            undead creatures and how to defeat, turn, banish them - how to send
            them finally to their eternal rest. (At the end of a hammer if need
            be.) It was something his order constantly prepared for, something
            his patroness commanded as their sacred duty.
            </p>
            <p>
            And yet she withheld her divine fire - refused to strike down the
            dead man. And here were undead creatures, standing idly, staring
            calmly at him, no apparent threat now that their leader had called
            them to stop. To strike at them now, despite their damnation, would
            be dishonorable.  An affront.
            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi was speaking with the leader, a dead man little different
            than the ones that lay mangled on the stones. He stood next to a
            skeletal minotaur, scant flesh still clinging to some of its ribs,
            that was about the same height as Aldoon. The Mind Flayer was
            saying “We are here for a book” as Aldoon gaped at the skull of a
            minotaur that, now that it knew there would be no more fighting,
            could only be described as bored. A bored Minotaur skeleton. Aldoon
            felt lightheaded.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Broken Man, black blood dripping from his hands, was presenting
            the Book of Rules to the zombie leader, and explaining that the
            rules stated that they must relinquish an item of treasure for each
            of Aldoon’s party, since it was agreed to stop the killing. “Look
            for yourself.” Aldoon was still reeling.
            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/garg_mask.png"></div>
            <p>
            As the leader (Garg. The zombie had a name, and it was Garg.) led
            them through the labyrinth of halls and passageways to the library,
            dis- appointment and confusion reigned in Aldoon’s mind.  He had felt
            certain he knew his role. He felt clear of purpose for one bright
            moment as he battled an enemy he knew. But now, he followed behind
            an abomination, walking past chambers that contained yet more
            undead creatures, shambling about or merely standing staring at
            nothing. And whenever he considered going forth anyway to send them
            to their rest - to do what he had been trained to do - he
            remembered the thin, anemic sacred light. He heard Garg’s raspy
            voice. (“Stop. the. Killing.”) Both were a rebuke, a message.
            “Unlearn your ways. Here, a new path must be forged.”
            </p>
            <p>
            They were in the library now, a sparse collection of ancient tomes.
            The Green-Skinned one held up a page fragment to the torchlight. It
            was a complex diagram very much like the one they had retrieved
            from the Waterdeep Bookseller.
            </p>
            <p>
            From Garg they learned that the diagram may be part of the drawings
            for a mechanism - a powerful mechanism that featured prominently in
            an ancient Blood War on the plane of Acheron.  The mechanism had
            been broken up, the pieces and plans scattered.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aldoon’s mind began to focus. With a mystery to engage his
            thoughts, his vaunted Loxodon Serenity calmed his nerves, allowed
            him to clear his mind. It was no accident that fragments of an
            ancient mystery appeared in both of the first tasks of their
            nefarious captor. What did Enkosi want of this mechanism? What did
            it do? What was this Blood War, and did the presumably immortal
            Enkosi play a part in it?
            </p>
            <p>
            The Green Skinned one and the Broken Man were already reproducing
            the drawing and noting similarities and differences between the
            last one. They discussed and drew and sketched and puzzled. Aldoon
            would rest and pray on it. He began to come to terms with a new
            reality for himself, a new path. Perhaps he was called to forge a
            new way of serving his patroness. He would pray for her guidance.
            He would wait to be shown what his new purpose might be.
            </p>
            <p>
            And of the mystery his new companions were puzzling out, he would
            watch, and listen. And he would find the role he must play.
            </p>

            Feuriel strode with conviction back toward the surface. Behind her,
            the voices of her companions were discussing something about...
            books was it?
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“So we can take any of these? Even this one, important enough that our master sent us to retrieve it?”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Yes, we have no further use for it. It has been studied and recorded. We have memorized and copied its contents.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“What about this one, about your deity, Nepthis?”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Yes, that one too. It contains the canon for our way of life, our very existence. But again, we know its contents thoroughly, and it would please us to see her Word spread to others. Take it...”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            It sounded like it was going quite well, but Feuriel had more important concerns. She had a purpose, at last.
            </p>
            <p>
            Although there had been some talk of resting, most of her
            companions upon seeing her determination accompanied Fueriel to the
            surface, back to the cave-like entrance of this undead complex. As
            she emerged into the vast dusty plains of this peculiar layer of
            Olympus, she immediately saw her quarry: the two opportunists who
            were waiting and hoping for an easy score.
            </p>
            <p>
            Seemingly oblivious to Feuriel’s mood and intentions, one of them
            asked, “So, do you have it? Did you bring us the vial?”
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“We do not have it, and neither shall you!”</em> Fuerial spoke,
            with rekindled angelic power infusing her words.  </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Then go back in there and get it!”</em> he replied, still
            having no ken of his fate.  Fueriel ignored him, and began to
            recite what would become his last rites.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“I have been sent here by Torm, God of Justice, to bring
            justice to places where justice is not often found, to bring
            justice to you. Go now. Leave this place, and you will be spared.
            Take yourself and your things, and leave, and never return.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“What?!”</em> he answered incredulously, <em>“You’re on their
                side? They’re cursed undead! What’s wrong with you?  They
                killed our friend, murdered him! We just came here to, um, get
                something, and now our friend is dead because of those
                monsters!”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel would hear none of it, but she gave the two men another
            chance for redemption. <em>“You came here to steal. To invade and to
                steal. These undead are peaceful,”</em> she retorted. She
            continued, quoting the doctrine of
            Torm: <em>“A being is judged not by its exterior but by its deeds,
                and words, and thoughts!”</em> </p>
            <p>
            She reflected on the current state of her tormented body as she
            said this. Interesting, how those words take on new meaning for her
            now. She continued:
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Your friend deserved to die for his deeds, and so shall you if
                you do not leave this place.”</em> Yet the two men refused to
            leave, and were clearly digging in their heels and preparing for a
            conflict, belligerent about their misguided aggression toward the
            undead commune. <em>“What about mercy?”</em> someone asked.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Once a decision is made, there is no mercy,” she answered.
                “God kills babies in their sleep.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            It was hyperbole, for sure, but it was effective. She could feel
            the two men shrinking away before her might, while her companions
            gathered to her cause. Unbeknownst to Feuriel, the illithid had
            probed the minds of the men, and whispered to the others, <em>“They
            intend to steal the potion of immortality, sell it, and stab each
            other in the back for it.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>The Fallen Angel spoke her verdict: <em>“Judgment has been passed
            and justice will be served. You shall
            perish.”</em></p>
            <p>The field erupted in battle. The Broken Man loosed a series of
            blasts from his arcane limbs, decimating the brains of one of the
            men, much to the illithid’s dismay. Aldoon launched magic stones
            into the fray. The others similarly unleashed their wrath on the
            two men who tried with futility to resist. Feuriel, sword aglow,
            strode confidently toward the remaining offender.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since her arrival in Hell, Feuriel had been tagging along with this
            group, a follower. But in this moment, they were following her, and
            her leadership. It felt glorious. Her allies pulled back, allowing
            Feuriel her moment with the last soul, as the man still dared to
            defy her.
            </p>
            <p>
            Wrath. Some angels specialized in this. Had she been one of them?
            She brought justice upon the man. He paid the ultimate price for
            his transgressions, and she prevented any further harm from coming
            to the peaceful community below her feet, by his hands anyway. It
            felt good. And it felt Good. Maybe this was why she was consigned
            to Hell? To gain access to injustices that Torm wouldn’t otherwise
            have? Was this her purpose? Was she Torm’s fury...?
            </p>
            <p>
            In the moments after the fight was over, Fueriel approached Alhoon, seeing him take a pause for prayer.</p>
            <p>
            <em>“Can you connect to your deity in this place?”</em> she asked.
            It seemed easy for him, yet eluded her.
            </p>
            <p>Alhoon seemed confused by the question. <em>“Why yes,”</em> he
            said, in the way you would expect a priest to answer such a
            question. <em>“The Sisters are with me in all things and all
                places.”</em> </p>
            <p>
            She pondered his answer. Connecting to a deity was strangely
            unfamiliar to her. She was used to being a manifestation of Torm
            himself, an extension of a deity, yet now she was disconnected,
            semi-mortal. She would need to learn how to be on the other end of
            a prayer. She closed her eyes and tried, but got no answer, or so
            she thought.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
            The party reunited, bringing the good news of “justice” back to
            Garg, the leader of the undead. Bandito, who was strangely absent
            from the skirmish on the surface had rejoined the party. Fueriel
            wondered briefly how many deeds the little bandit had committed
            which would align him closer with the two dead men up on the plains
            than with herself.
            </p>
            <p>She dismissed the thought. She was too caught up
            in her own uncertainty, her own introspection, to worry about
            Bandito. Meanwhile, her companions were intent upon some new
            information, an exchange of some sort with Garg. Something about
            books again, a diagram, a map or coordinates, or something.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fueriel had little interest in books and treasures, knowledge and
            other material things. Many beings craved such things, but not her,
            not yet. Although, she did feel cravings, remnants of the 666 lives
            she lived as she was repeatedly ripped through the Prime as she
            Fell. For now, she was pondering her grand purpose, while
            the others focused on their own immediate purpose.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
            She should have paid closer attention, for their immediate purpose
            quickly became her own. The party was on a boat now, and a
            disgusting one at that. They were sailing--rowing?--on the infamous
            River Styx. Upon their return from Arborea with new information,
            Enkosee wasted no time sending the group out on their next quest.
            </p>
            <p>
            Apparently, the items recovered from the undead complex were
            sufficient to identify the previously-unknown location of a
            forgotten but significant battle in the history of the Blood War.
            All they were expecting to find there was a crater, but perhaps the
            crater held a clue to something important and powerful, something
            that had been lost for a very long time.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Is there nothing to eat on this ship?”</em> Feuriel demanded
            of their especially inhospitable captain, the inaccurately-named
            Orgath the Beautiful. Perhaps he was beautiful on the inside? Nope.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“You can drink the Styx if you like!” he jeered. “See how that
                goes for you.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>She had half a mind to try it. Doubt about her divine purpose
            had returned, while the feelings of wrath and fury hadn’t much
            subsided. It was going to be a long and miserable voyage, but at
            least she wasn’t one of the enslaved rowers. However, as she
            remembered the sea of suffering, disincorporated souls and the
            horrific fate the paladin on Day One, she reconsidered that these
            oarsmen in Hell were perhaps the lucky ones.
            </p>
            <p>
            A goodberry and some purify food a drink from her companions, who
            clearly had much stronger connections to divine and arcane power
            than she did, helped snap Fueriel’s mood back to a calmer place.
            </p>
            <p>
            Grand purpose? She shrugged it off. For now, her purpose should be
            to tolerate this boat ride, and to figure out what artifact or
            ancient power they were headed toward, and what it meant for her.
            Perhaps that is why she was put here?...
            </p>
            <h3 class="break">Week 6</h3>
            <strong><em>from the perspective of Crokiak (DM notes edition)</em></strong>
            <p>
            The River Styx led them through falls and chasms, emerging at last into Acheron. Orgoth the Beautiful - a name that Crokiak found increasingly ironic with each passing hour - guided them to the coordinates Enkosee had provided. What they found was a crater, massive and ancient, gouged into the landscape like a wound that had never healed.
            </p>
            <p>
            At the bottom, a silvery pool glowed faintly. Enkosee had not mentioned this. The party stood at the crater's edge, debating.
            </p>
            <p>
            Crokiak picked up a decrepit helmet - a relic of the ancient battle that had created this crater - and tossed it in. The helmet floated on the surface, buoyant in the strange liquid. It did not sink. It did not dissolve. It simply... waited.
            </p>
            <p>
            Someone had to go first. Crokiak volunteered.
            </p>
            <p>
            He dove in - and found that the pool had no bottom, only another top. He emerged into a moonscape, a junkyard stretching to every horizon. Stone artifacts, crumbling structures, what appeared to be ships embedded awkwardly into the ground. Canyons and chasms carved through the debris. A single small star hung low on the horizon, casting dim light that might have been late dusk or early dawn.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            The others followed. Together, they pressed into a canyon that wound through the debris, the walls rising high on either side. Crokiak felt the weight of the stone pressing in - a claustrophobic intimacy that reminded him of the tunnels back home in Limbo.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then he noticed the remains.
            </p>
            <p>
            At first, they appeared to be statues - spherical and box-shaped forms frozen in stone. Modrons, Crokiak realized. The nature of this place had petrified them over millennia. But as they progressed deeper into the canyon, the remains shifted. Half-petrified. Half-metal. Still stone in places, but mechanical in others.
            </p>
            <p>
            And then, up ahead, he saw her.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            A figure stood motionless in the canyon. She appeared to be a human female, but as Crokiak drew closer, he saw that the majority of her body was mechanical in nature - a reconstruction of metal, gears, and arcane circuitry built upon what remained of organic flesh.
            </p>
            <p>
            When she looked up at him, her eyes held a strange depth. She spoke in a voice that was human, but overlaid with something mechanical - and she referred to herself only in the collective.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We are here to protect this place until the Primus returns."
            </p>
            <p>
            Crokiak began to ask questions, but something was wrong. The ancient machinery around them was stirring. The half-petrified Modrons in the canyon walls were shaking free of their stone shells, joints sparking and stuttering. The conversation had triggered something - a defense protocol, perhaps, or simply the realization that intruders had come.
            </p>
            <p>
            The figure's expression changed. Her eyes went cold, mechanical, rational.
            </p>
            <p>
            And then she attacked.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 7</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Verthandi (Chris Sweitzer)</em></strong>
            <p>
            The Reconstructed One stood in from them, wailing. She smashed a
            jagged spike into one of the Modron that had risen up against them.
            Krokiak’s machinations had disabled the Modron’s control over the
            creature but unfortunately not stopped the waking of rest of the
            Modron. Verthandi was definitely having second thoughts about
            having mind blasted her as blood dripped down from the jagged wound
            in his side. He was no soldier, but looking at his companions, none
            of them appeared to be either, save for the angel, and she always
            on the verge of collapse. He wasn’t sure how long they would be
            able to hold out against such odds.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thankfully even magical machines don’t work very well after more
            than a thousand years of sitting on the floor of such a cavernous
            canyon. As two of the spherical Modrons went to attack Verthandi,
            dust and grit in its joints caused a shower of sparks to emanate
            from them.  One missed completely while the other only made a
            glancing blow off his shield. Maybe they had a chance after all.
            Then several other larger Modron, boxes this time instead of
            spheres, started to shake free a millennium of regolith and come
            towards them as well.
            </p>
            <p>
            Krokiak, Verthandi, and the two mechanical people stood at one end
            of the remains of the ship while Feuriel, Aldoon, and Bandito faced
            up against almost twice as many at the other, including more of the
            box-shaped Modrons. Again though, as the Modrons attacked, their
            joints seemed to spark and stutter. Feuriel seemed to shrug off an
            onslaught, despite her fragility. But it wouldn’t last. The Modron
            in front of Verthandi were already moving more freely than a few
            seconds ago, preparing to attack again. He doubted they would
            survive a second round.
            </p>
            <p>
            As his companions chipped away at the creatures, Verthandi noticed
            that they weren’t very tactical creatures. Natural animals, or even
            the unnatural ones that Verthandi preferred, tended to
            unconsciously work together, but these Modron seemed to be working
            independently, getting in each others’ way and clumping together,
            which meant they were vulnerable to Verthandi’s magic.
            </p>
            <p>
            He quickly calculated that he could get them all with one
            thunderwave spell. He almost started casting when he realized he
            was going to catch everyone, including his own side, in the attack.
            While he thought they would survive, he didn’t want to have to face
            down any remaining enemies alone if he did kill his own party. He
            wouldn’t be able to get them all, but it should be enough for him
            to back away without being gutted.
            </p>
            <p>
            A wave of thunder spread out in front of Verthandi. One of the
            spherical Modron flew backwards, crashing against ground in a
            shower of sparks. Another managed to keep itself stationary, but
            still collapsed afterwards. The larger cube Modron stood against
            the wave, but was clearly badly damaged by the spell. Verthandi
            backed away, hoping Crokiak and crew would be able to finish off
            the remaining Modron.
            </p>
            <p>
            On the other front, Feuriel and Aldoon appeared to be holding their
            own, but a few attacks had gotten through, and only luck had
            preventing a few of the shots from bringing them down. Verthandi
            moved to one side and threw his last thunderwave through the Modron
            while Aldoon did same on the other side, smashing the Modron
            against walls of the canyon.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“That’s it for me,”</em> said Verthandi, preparing to move away
            again, as the remaining Modron moved against Aldoon and Feuriel,
            but he shouldn’t have worried as they quickly mopped them up. The
            final Modron leapt upon Aldoon, only to be shattered by more
            thunder.  At the other end Krokiak and crew had finished up as
            well, leaving only the party and the Reconstructed One.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“No, I no longer have to obey you,”</em> she was saying. She
            explained that she and her friends had travelled here on a
            Spelljammer ship, whatever that was. They had been attacked by a
            group of Gith that had slaughter everyone, including her, but that
            she was saved by the Modron in this canyon, only to be turned into
            a automaton with no free will, left to protect the ostium artifact
            that the party had been sent to find. As if remembering their duty,
            the group began to search the area, leaving the two machines to
            speak.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“The Modron placed something inside my head to control me. But
                that one,”</em> she said, pointing to Crokiak, <em>“seems to
                have severed its link. It can still speak to me, but it can’t
                make me do anything.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“That is good,”</em> gravelled the other machine.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“I was called Mel once. Thank you for saving me. I am in your
                debt.”</em> </p>
            <p>
            <em>“I had a name once, it was Zoltano. Do you know where the
                ostium is?”</em> </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi’s tentacles perked up at the name. He thought it was the
            first time the mech had ever referred to himself by name. It
            certainly would make it easier to keep track of everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel shook her head. <em>“The Modron knows, but it won’t tell
                me.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, the rest of the party found what appeared to be a plinth
            with Modron engravings on it, but no ostium. Clearly the ostium had
            been here, but where? Mel told them she had never seen the ostium,
            and then they realized how literally calling her the ostium
            guardian was.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“It’s inside of her,”</em> said Verthandi. The others had come
            to the same conclusion.  Ripping it out of her probably wouldn’t be
            a issue, but Verthandi assumed that Feuriel and the broken man would
            probably object, especially if it killed her, which it probably
            would. Besides, their job wasn’t to find the ostium, but rather
            just explore this area to see if it was here. They did. It wasn’t.
            They could bring back the plinth to show Enkosee what they found,
            and if Mel was discovered, claim ignorance. She was just another
            Modron that Krokiak had subverted to their side.
            </p>
            <p>
            As they travelled back though, Verthandi wondered how well their
            plan would work. A quick magic detection spell and Mel lit up
            brighter than the sun, and Verthandi’s attempt to infiltrate her
            body by transforming into a neogi hatchling to try and find the
            ostium proved fruitless. Aldoon also noticed a Gith ship flying
            around nearby, but thankfully it did not notice them.
            </p>
            <p>
            After traveling back through the portal pool, they started to
            relax, until several of them noticed that someone was waiting for
            them on the ridge of the crater that encircled the pool.  As they
            approached, they found a man wearing noble garb and a relaxed look
            on his face, which was odd considering the rather distinctive
            makeup of their group.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Hello my friends,”</em> he said. <em>“I am the Flaneur.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            He was a noble from Waterdeep who had been following them almost
            since the beginning of their adventures. He noted that while they
            had tricked a man into selling his soul, they had also saved the
            unlives of a group of undead.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“We are a complex alliance,”</em> said Verthandi.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“You are indeed,”</em> replied the Flaneur.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Perhaps you should continue to follow us, to see what we
                do,”</em> suggested Feuriel, which the Flaneur seemed to think
            was a grand idea.
            </p>
            <p>
            After taking their leave of the Flaneur, the party returned to the
            ship and its unpleasant captain who’s name Verthandi couldn’t
            remember, and they started heading back to Hell. This was not going
            to go well, he thought. Krokiak would probably tell Enkosee about
            the ostium, just from his intellectual banter that he always made,
            or the massive amount of magical power emanating from her would
            make it obvious. Or Bandito would attempt to steal the ostium from
            inside her and reveal it, and Verthandi wasn’t completely convinced
            that he couldn’t do it.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was almost a relief when the ship was attacked.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 8 - A Boatload of Demons</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Feurial (Jay Pancoast)</em></strong>
            <p>
            It had been a day or two of miserable sailing on the River Styx, on
            the ship they had come to know as the Handbasket. The band was
            quiet, keeping their thoughts to themselves, as usual. There was
            too much yet to understand, and too much risk in discussing it
            here. And so the hours dragged on, until...
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Listen!”</em> said Aldoon, <em>“Do you smell something?”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Sure enough, there was a new stench in the air. It was not the
            noxious brimstone of Hell, but something differently evil, almost
            sweet: decay, feces, with a sharp tang of bile. Demons.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“A ship approaches!”</em> someone called out. And in no time it
            was visible to the rest of those onboard. A galley as large as
            Orgoth’s own not-so-beautiful ship emerged from the crimson mists
            as it came around a bend in the River Styx. Its decks were packed
            with the brutes of the Abyss, demons known as dretch. At its helm
            was a creature unknown to most, a merrenoloth which seemed to
            control the huge ship with just a wave of its fiendish hand.
            </p>
            <p>
            Swirling in darkness, the faceless captain of the demonic crew, a
            shadow demon, hissed its orders to the dretch in their Abyssal
            language, <em>“Attack! Kill them all, or die trying!”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Aboard the Handbasket, Enkosee’s slaves and servants took up battle
            positions. The elite band of adventurers who had been bound by the
            Call of the Inferno reacted with a decisive effectiveness that took
            Orlath by surprise as he jeered his deckhands into action. The
            demon ship was closing fast.
            </p>
            <p>
            Within moments, a pre-emptive strike was launched upon the demon
            ship. Calling upon Iolensis, Aldoon brought destructive power onto
            the bow of the enemy ship, blasting a hole in its hull and
            destroying two demons in the explosion. Verthandi followed suit,
            filling the foredecks of the ship with abhorrent purplish vines
            which boasted vicious barbed spikes. The scene soon disappeared
            from view however, as Elusurm, the Broken Man, shrouded the
            encroaching deck with impenetrable darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, Feuriel had found her quarry: the shadow demon who led
            the enemy forces. A wicked grin spread across her face as a
            perverse mix of righteousness and bloodlust welled up within her at
            the thought of vanquishing demons again. She flexed her wings, as
            was her habit in her prior existence, and this time, the charred
            stumps of past glory sprang to new life, growing outward into fully
            fledged angelic wings. She wouldn’t notice until later that her
            wings were different now, dark shadows of her former glory. She
            took to the air to close with her foe.
            </p>
            <p>
            Waves of thunder, blasts of eldritch energy, magical stones, and a
            repeating barrage of crossbow bolts careened across the deck,
            spanning the narrowing gap between the two ships, and slaying demon
            after demon as the volleys found their marks.
            </p>
            <p>
            Again, Aldoon called upon Iolensis, and again she answered, as a
            powerful gust of wind erupted from the loxodon, blasting into the
            oncoming ship and pushing it backward. This delayed the demons’
            boarding plan, and allowed the team of misfits to continue their
            offensive unchallenged.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, the demonic ship was not propelled by winds nor buoyed by
            seaworthiness as a normal ship would be, but by ill omen, by the
            otherworldly will of the merrenoloth. The ship continued to close.
            </p>
            <p>
            Lost in the fantasy of being something she no longer was, Feuriel
            charged the shadow demon. She called forth her angelic power to
            project a beam of radiance from her sword to her foe, but she
            instead got a crackling hellfire which erupted from her arm,
            charring her flesh and missing its target. She dug deeper into her
            conviction and ignited her sword with a sacred energy that would
            surely vanquish this affront to her order! Yet, as she brought her
            blade through the demon, although the radiant steel sliced a
            glowing gash through its dark, astonished body, the demon still
            lived. What was this blasphemy? Where had her power gone? Who was
            she?
            </p>
            <p>
            And then she remembered, that she didn’t know anymore who she was,
            who she served, or what her purpose was at all.
            </p>
            <p>
            Dejected, she let her sword fall limply to her side as, from behind
            her, she heard her devout ally Aldoon call again to his goddess,
            who again answered resoundingly. In front of her, the shadow demon
            exploded into a golden cloud of glitter and was no more.
            </p>
            <p>
            Around her, the chaos of the battle intensified. Quasits, small
            bat-like demons, had been released from their cages by the
            merrenoloth, and now they surged around Feuriel and her allies.
            Thunder, eldritch blasts, magical projectiles and faerie fires
            pounded her ears and flashed across her eyes as demons were
            obliterated left and right. Her allies clearly had mastered their
            new bodies, their new skills and abilities, their new lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finding a memory, a spark of hope, Feuriel recited a cherished
            prayer, <em>“Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
            death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me...”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            But her hope was extinguished, her faith challenged again, as a
            trio of quasits set upon her, ignoring her defensive prayer and
            tearing her to pieces. She felt their poison seep into her black
            veins. She almost welcomed it. What is one more death anyway? But
            she couldn’t let go. From somewhere--was it Torm or was it her own
            resolve--she found she still had fight in her. She pushed through
            the poison and cleaved her sword through the remaining quasit that
            her allies hadn’t picked off of her.
            </p>
            <p>
            She regained her focus and sought out the merrenoloth, who had
            suffered greatly from Elusurm’s relentless eldritch barrage, yet as
            she turned her attention to it, it erupted in another deadly
            showcase of Iolenthis’s splendor, wielded by Aldoon. Feuriel envied
            the cleric.
            </p>
            <p>
            The battle was almost over now. Only a few dretch remained, and two
            quasits that were fleeing the scene.  Orgoth’s deckhands helped
            Crokiak and Verthandi finish off the dretch, while Elusurm blasted
            one of the escaping quasits to bits. Feuriel took aim at the other.
            Again, her god failed her. The quasit shrugged off the paltry fire
            she evoked and kept flying. It was of course Aldoon who was able to
            smite it. Iolensis sent a beam of heavenly flame, down from the
            very skies of Hell in fact, as a gift to her devoted follower.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was just too much. Relieved to have survived, but feeling more
            alone than she had ever felt, Feuriel let her wings carry her back
            to the ship’s sterncastle. It was then that she noticed her wings
            were not the luxurious white feathers of a swan, but were the
            greasy black tatters of vulture wings.  Black feathers littered the
            deck.  They were hers. She fell to her knees, and then collapsed
            into a heap, sobbing. Her feathers continued to fall out as she
            wept, uncontrollably, until her wings were just bare stubs again.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Why?”</em> she whimpered, over and over.
            </p>
            <p>
            No one answered.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 9 - Skirmish in the Scribery</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Mel Selene</em></strong>
            <p>
            Mel Selene stood on the deck of the sinking demon ship, surrounded by carnage. She had fought alongside these creatures - these strangers - for the first time since her liberation. They moved with practiced efficiency, looting the dead and claiming their spoils. She was learning quickly that this was how things worked in Hell.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>No, stop analyzing. You're not a machine. Stop.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            The Modron voice in her head was cold, clinical, always observing. She had learned to argue with it over the centuries. Sometimes she won. Sometimes she just shouted at it to shut up.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Shut up," she muttered under her breath.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Loxodon, Aldoon, glanced at her with concern. She ignored him.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Crates marked "Food" in Infernal had been broken open to reveal not provisions, but slaves - nineteen dwarves huddled together in the dark, blinking against the light. The party's reaction to this discovery varied dramatically, and Mel found herself studying them, cataloging their responses the way she used to catalog ancient artifacts.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aldoon and the mechanical one called Elusurm - or was it Zoltano? She still struggled with names - discussed what should become of them with genuine concern. They spoke of freedom, of finding them passage home, of doing what was right. Good people, she thought. Or at least, people trying to be good.
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito the Harengon seemed more interested in what he could steal from the cargo. Not evil, exactly. Just... practical. Survival-oriented. She understood that.
            </p>
            <p>
            Krokiak - the Githzerai who had freed her - was quiet, technical, focused on mechanisms and systems. He had seen the Modron control interface in her body and disabled it with surgical precision. She owed him more than she could ever repay. But she did not know him, not really.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel was a cipher - a fallen angel wrestling with her own nature, prone to violent outbursts and sudden despair. Mel had watched her collapse on the deck after the battle, wings shedding black feathers, weeping for reasons Mel did not fully understand. There was pain there. Mel recognized pain.
            </p>
            <p>
            And then there was Verthandi.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            The Illithid claimed his share of the loot with the others, but when it came time to divide the slaves, he made his intentions horrifyingly clear.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel had seen death. She had watched Githyanki pirates slaughter her friends - Jalena falling under a hail of blows, Morkak taking three enemies with him before he died, Damocleus crumpling with an arrow through his throat. She had lain broken in the wreckage of her spelljammer, watching them burn her journals, laughing as they left her for dead.
            </p>
            <p>
            But she had never seen anything like this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi drew one of the dwarves aside. The screaming did not last long, but the wet, wet sounds did. Mel forced herself to watch. She needed to understand what kind of creature she had allied herself with. When it was over, the dwarf's body lay crumpled on the deck, and Verthandi wiped something dark from his tentacles with an expression of mild satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Nutritional efficiency optimal. Recommend acquiring additional specimens for long-term sustenance planning.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            "SHUT UP!" Mel shouted, and several heads turned toward her.
            </p>
            <p>
            She was trembling. She owed these people her freedom. But the Illithid ate brains. The Illithid was part of this group. And she was sworn to serve them.
            </p>
            <p>
            What had she gotten herself into?
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Panulis met them at the docks when they returned to Uman Yango. The twisted gnome's eyes went wide when he saw Mel - a new addition to their number, clearly not a devil, clearly not damned. He asked questions. The others gave answers. Mel stayed silent, watching, learning.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then they were brought before Enkosee.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel had never met a devil of such rank. He appeared almost human - tall, distinguished, with an air of cultivated sophistication that seemed at odds with everything she had heard about Hell. But when he examined her, she felt the weight of his attention like a physical force. Something in her chest seemed to pulse - a strange warmth she did not understand, deep within her mechanical components.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Threat assessment: extreme. Probability of dissection: 73.6%. Recommend full tactical disclosure and cooperative integration with superior force.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel gritted her teeth. She would not give him the satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Tell me, pet," Enkosee said, "how did my dear colleagues come to have you in their service?"
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel met his gaze. "I spent a thousand years gazing into the abyss, immobile, wanting to die. They freed me. I owe them my life, and my sanity."
            </p>
            <p>
            Enkosee studied her for a long moment. "I do believe this one is telling the truth."
            </p>
            <p>
            The party explained that she was another Modron unit, subverted by Krokiak's technical expertise. A useful asset, nothing more. Enkosee seemed satisfied. "She will make an excellent addition to my collection," he said, and Mel did not know whether to feel relieved or terrified. "Well done. You may keep your pet. The pet of a pet - how amusing."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Enkosee rewarded them with gold and offered them time to visit the bazaar while he studied the plinth they had recovered. The others scattered to spend their coin. Mel followed, still learning the dynamics of this strange group.
            </p>
            <p>
            She was their pet now. Their asset. Their tool.

            <p>
            "I know," she said quietly. "I know."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            It was during this downtime that someone suggested returning to the Scribery - the great archive where Panulis worked, where they had first obtained the Book of Rules. Mel had never been there, but she could tell by the way the others spoke that they expected it to be as they had left it.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was not.
            </p>
            <p>
            The smell hit them before they reached the doors. Blood and offal and something sulfurous. Inside, the great hall was a slaughterhouse. Bodies of the twisted gnome scribes lay scattered among their tables, torn apart and partially consumed. The shelves had been toppled. Parchment was everywhere, soaked through with ichor.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hell hounds.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            The creatures emerged from the shadows - three of them, massive and snarling, their pelts smoking with infernal heat. Jaws dripping with the remains of the scribes they had been devouring.
            </p>
            <p>
            The battle was brutal but brief. The party had fought demons on a sinking ship; hell hounds, for all their ferocity, were lesser prey. Feuriel's blade flashed. Aldoon called down divine wrath. Verthandi filled the air with eldritch power. Even Mel herself joined the fray, her integrated weapons systems humming to life, a thousand years of rage channeled into every strike.
            </p>
            <p>
            When the last hell hound fell, Krokiak stood among the carnage, his expression troubled. He was looking at the remains of a gnome who had been torn apart - half-eaten, beyond any hope of repair.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I can't fix that," he said quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel watched him. He was not like the others. He felt the weight of failure. He wished he could undo what had been done. She understood that feeling.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Then came the realization.
            </p>
            <p>
            The imps. The ones the party had killed when they first came to the Scribery, weeks ago. The imps in the rafters, scratching at the scribes, keeping them working. They had seemed like pests at the time, and the party had slaughtered them without a second thought.
            </p>
            <p>
            But the imps had been doing more than driving the scribes. They had been keeping the hell hounds at bay.
            </p>
            <p>
            Without the imps, the hounds had escaped. They had come here, to the Scribery, and they had feasted.
            </p>
            <p>
            The party traced the trail of destruction back through the corridors, following the hell hounds' path to its source. To a row of prison cells where the guards were cursing and confused, where the hounds had simply... left their posts.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            They found him in the corridor outside the cells.
            </p>
            <p>
            A centaur. Battered, bruised, but standing. A glaive in each hand. Devil guards lay dead at his hooves.
            </p>
            <p>
            He looked at the party - this bizarre collection of creatures that had stumbled into his escape - and Mel saw him weigh his options. Fight, flee, or parley.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Will you fight me?" he asked. "Follow me? Or leave me be?"
            </p>
            <p>
            He was not of this place. He was a prisoner, like they had been. Like she had been.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel watched as the party negotiated with the centaur, who called himself Captain Teelo Rence. Another stray. Another lost soul in this hellscape.
            </p>
            <p>
            She understood that feeling better than most.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 10 - Teelo's Run</h3>
            <strong><em>From the journal of Captain Teelo Rence (NPC)</em></strong>
            <p>It has now been several days since my capture by the forces of the enemy, although perhaps it's weeks?  Months?  Does time move differently here?  The attack did not go as planned.  The rank and file of the devil army is predictable, if anything, and our raid on the enemy supply line should have fared as well the others that came before it.  This time was different.  It seems a higher intelligence has taken over their operations and they baited us into an ambush.  I should have known.  How many of my Fae friends lie dead now from my own failure.  I must make amends to Her.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I had been expecting nothing but torture, pain, interrogation, and damnation from the denizens of this place.  In that order.  Yet I have received only occasional beatings and humiliation from the guards so far.  They evidently do not know my rank, and I continue to feign not knowing to where I have been consigned.  Continue to play the role of the dumb soldier, and you may just buy yourself enough time to find a way out of here.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I cannot expect any rescue efforts to be made on my behalf this far into the bowels of the enemy's home territory.  I must make my own escape, though how?  I cannot commune with Her while under the watch of the guards.  I could probably overcome them, but those hellhounds would tear me to shreds within moments.  I will meditate and contemplate this further.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Opportunity knocks,  I have awoken to discover the guards cursing the hellhounds absence.  They appear to have departed while I slept and have not returned.  One of the guards has left swearing he'll make a hellhound skin cloak when he finds them.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Opportunity indeed.  I was able to overcome the guard, yet upon departing the cell I find myself among the oddest collections of creatures I have ever seen (and odd creatures are my specialty), yet they were obviously not guards.  Killers yes, but not of this place, and not hostile to me.  Gods, they even travel with an Illithid.</p>
            <p>I continued my charade, as they appeared to have the run of the place.  Mercenaries?  No.  Prisoners?  Unlikely.  Damned?  Hard to tell.  I will continue to play my role until, gods willing, I make it out of here.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>While still suspicious of me, they appear to take me for the dullard I portray.  There is no harm in this, my ego can take the slights and it's all in the name of the cause anyway.  I had hoped I could find somewhere quiet to invoke the ritual of communion, but I do not believe I could slip away from them at the moment.  Besides, they do not appear to be pleased to be in this place either.  Perhaps they would make useful allies if we can escape.  I can sense good among them, as well as evil, but every tool has it's use and it's purpose.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Their suspicions dwindle, along with their discresion.  I have overheard much, including the fortuidous circumstances leading to my escape.  It seems that the hell hounds had left in order to consume some sort of gnome librarians with whom they were familiar.  The green one in particular (a Gith of some sort?  Githzerai most likely.) appears upset that "he couldn't fix that".  Not an infernal sentiment to have.</p>
            <p>From what I can piece together, they had battled these hellhounds within a library, ultimately slaying all of the devilish dogs.  An impressive feat, and my confidence that I can recruit them to the cause grows.  In fact two of them, a Loxodon and another of a type even I have never witnessed (some sort of intelligent golem?) discuss between them what they hope will become of some slaves they had freed.  They appear genuinely concerned for their welfare.</p>
            <p>The Illithid is silent, saying nothing.  From what the others say amongst themselves this creature had been strategically critical in their fight against the hellhounds.  I must remain wary of this one, Gods know the cause could use any help it can get, yet I know their cooperation would last only as long as the mutual alignment of our goals.</p>
            <p>Strangest of all to find in this place is some sort of Celestial.  I am yet to ascertain exactly how this is possible, though they appear to be undergoing an existential crisis.  I sense anger, doubt, and envy from them.  They stand on the edge of an abyss, but perhaps recruiting them for the cause will give them an anchor and standard for which them to rally their faith.</p>
            <p>The Harengon, "Bandito" they call him, and the Drow Baloth want to visit some sort of market or bazaar.  While a distraction from my goal, I can use the opporunity to rearm myself.  But I must eventually find a quiet place to commune.  Perhaps they know of one.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Rearmed, I am beginning to feel whole again.  My fellows, while nefarious in aspect appear to have a generous and even somewhat honorable nature.  Not at all what I expected to find.  Now some of them tire, and seek to rest.  I will use this opportunity to commune with Her.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I am home.  The communion ritual was successful, and She brought me through to the Grove along with the others.  I felt as though something back there was resisting my efforts, but what can you expect from the infernal realm.  In the end it matters not.  I am home.  Judging by the sun, we will not reach Mythras by nightfall and will have to make camp.  There is a clearing I know some miles from the Hedge where we can stop and rest.  Undoubtadly we will be attacked by those graceful beasts of the night, but I want to see how my new companions can handle themselves.  They've put on a show of defeating infernals, but if they can survive a real fight then they may just be what we need to tip the balance in our favor.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>They are worthy.  I must bring them to Her and recruit them to the cause.</p>
            <h3 class="break">Week 11 - Nature O Path</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Verthandi (Chris Sweitzer)</em></strong>
            <p>Verthandi wished they had not come to this place.  Nature has structure.  Nature is hierarchical.  Nature is brutal.  This plane had none of that.  It was a cacophony of colors and shapes and smells with no pattern he could discern.  And the worst of it was that it all seemed to coexist together peacefully.  They had, of course, been attacked their ﬁrst night by some local denizens, but that was to be expected considering they were essentially invaders of this land.  Even the most docile of creatures will defend its home if threatened.</p>

            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/teelo.jpg"></div>
            <p>The centaur, Teelo, was taking them to a place called Mythras.  Verthandi assumed it was going to be more of the same.  Haphazard design and no thought to the correct order of things.  It was maddening.  At least Hell, with all its torture and misery, made sense to Verthandi.  He knew the rules, Zoltano has a whole book of them, and that meant he knew how to get around them.  But a place like this had no rules to circumvent.  As they trudged through the forest, or jungle, or whatever it was, Verthandi once again wondered if this was truly their own plan, or if they were being led by the tentacle down a predetermined path by Enkosee.  He had to know sending them to the Scribery would have ended up with them killing the imps, which led to the hellhounds slaughtering the gnomes, allowing Teelo to conveniently escape with his party.  But why?</p>

            <p>Mythras was exactly as Verthandi expected.  Dominated by a large tree, the rest of the city looked as if had been built by a blind man with an inner ear imbalance.  Everything was slanted.  They had to walk halfway around the city to get to a cottage where Teelo told them they could stay during their time in the city.  At least they got a bit of an idea as to why they had been brought here.  The locals were at war with a group of devils.  Suddenly, their arrival here made a lot more sense.</p>

            <p>Verthandi took a much closer look at Teelo.  He seemed diﬀerent than the other centaurs.  He clearly had some stature here, as a few of the other centaurs they passed by called him “Captain Teelo.”  Physically he looked no diﬀerent, but mentally he seemed possibly modiﬁed.  Verthandi wondered if it was by the devils or by whoever ruled this land.</p>

            <p>Teelo told them that they would meet with the Lady of the Tree the next day, and that she would provide them more information about their battle with the devils.  The rest of the party seemed to be enjoying themselves here.  Aldoon had noticed a temple of some sort that they passed by.  Bandito was eyeing every shiny object in the city.  Feuriel looked more relaxed than normal, but said little and seemed far away.  Crokiak was his usual self, looking at everything, his hands reﬂexively moving as if he were ﬁxing small imperfections in buildings and creatures.  Zoltano was constantly checking the book of rules, no doubt preparing for dealing with the devils that were encroaching on this area.</p>

            <p>And then there was the Drow.  If Verthandi didn’t know better, he would have assumed that he was a spy placed by Enkosee, but then he remembered that the Drow had been there when they ﬁrst arrived in Hell.  He was an illusionist of some sort, but had largely disappeared after their arrived.  Verthandi had thought he must not have been a very good illusionist because he never reappeared after that, but now he was back, and certainly they could use the help, especially if they didn’t want it getting back to Enkosee about what they were doing here.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>The city was a mix of various races, with elves and nymphs and dryads and all sorts of other woodland creatures.  No one seemed to be in charge, apart from the aforementioned Lady of the Tree.  Food was provided, and Verthandi decided to turn into a creature he learned about from his book of aberrations callled a durer.  It allowed him to consume an entire badger whole, instead of just it’s brain, which wouldn’t have sustained him enough.  These folk clearly did not know how to properly entertain illithid.</p>

            <p>Suddenly Bandito started looking around.  <i>“We’re being watched,”</i> he said.  <i>“By more than one creature.”</i>  The others started peering out windows.  The Drow even started preparing a spell.  Where they about to be attacked?  With his superior night vision, Verthandi was able to see that an elf and a nymph were outside their cottage, but they only seemed to be watching.  They weren’t seemingly readying an attack.  Verthandi settled down a bit, staring at tree that was right outside their window, and then he realized that there were no trees that large near their cottage when they ﬁrst arrived.  It was an ent.</p>


            <p><i>“Where do you keep your mind?”</i> Verthandi asked the ent telepathically.  Making contact was surprisingly easy for a creature that presumably was made of mostly wood.  <i>“Inside of me”</i> was the only response he got.</p>

            <p>The next day, they met with the Lady of the Tree outside her tree.  She appeared as some kind of ephemeral being.  Verthandi assumed that her actual body was the tree itself, but he assumed asking her whether that was true would probably be rude.  As he was wondering about this, he felt another mind enter his telepathically.</p>

            <p>Each member of the party appeared to also be experiencing the same invasion.  He could tell a few of them resisted, but Verthandi didn’t bother, instead using the opportunity to try and ﬁnd out what he could about the Lady.  Sadly, he wasn’t able to tell exactly what she was.</p>

            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/lady_mythras.jpg"></div>
            <p>After the mental intrusion, the Lady explained what was happening.  Apparently a devil named Ceranos was searching for something, and had made an agreement with a water sprite named Jarvik to strip mine the land looking for this item.  The Lady was sending Teelo to negotiate with Ceranos, and wanted us to go along both to protect Teelo and also to try and ﬁgure out a way to get out of this agreement.  The meeting place was an area called “The Stands” about half a day away.</p>

            <p>The group agreed to go, without asking for anything in return, although without promising to actual help the forest creatures.  Verthandi thought it might be better to intervene on the side of the devils, but he wanted to meet this Ceranos ﬁrst.  He also worried about the weak heartedness of some of their party.  Then again, it’s possible that the Lady of the Tree could break their link to Hell, which certainly would be a beneﬁt as well.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>They had a few hours to pass before needing to leave for the Stands.  Aldoon went oﬀ to clean up the temple they had passed.  Some of the others went to purchase some potions, while Bandito simply stole one.  Verthandi just closed his mind and tried to consider what he could do to make this place more orderly.  Certainly introducing a more dominant species to subjugate the current residents would make everything better.  The devils were actually doing a pretty decent job at that already, but he knew they had their own agenda, and couldn’t be trusted to stick around once that was complete.  That’s when he noticed that Mel seemed to be in some distress.</p>

            <p><i>“I’ve felt strange ever since that…woman…looked inside of me,”</i> she said.  Verthandi worried that the Lady may have detected the ostium.  Had they erred in bringing her along?  Of course, leaving her in Hell where Enkosee could ﬁnd her was probably a bad idea as well.</p>

            <p>Verthandi cast a quick spell, and oﬀered her an improved goodberry, which she consumed, he thought more to appease him than because it helped.  No one else seemed to like his improved goodberries.  They dispensed with the need for digestion as they already contained bile within them.  He didn’t understand why people seemed to dislike them.</p>

            <p>Finally they headed out to the Stands, led by Teelo.  The Stands turned out to be made up of several cabins, and the party took position inside of them to wait for Ceranos to arrive.  Verthandi stayed in the back, as the appearance of an illithid might be more memorable than he liked, and he didn’t want their whereabouts to be reported back to Enkosee.  Teelo waited outside, with Zoltano and Crokiak standing near the doors.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>Ceranos and her retinue showed up right on time.  She looked to be a pretty standard devil.  Certainly she was not very high ranking.  Verthandi thought she probably wasn’t nearly on the same level as Enkosee, but then, he was hardly an expert on devil society.  He wondered again if maybe Enkosee manipulated them to come here to thwart Ceranos, or maybe to help her.  He still wasn’t sure.  Or maybe he was seeing conspiracies where none existed.  Not seeing conspiracies though is what ended up sending him to Hell to begin with, so he felt he had the right to be suspicious.</p>

            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/ceranos.jpg"></div>
            <p><i>“We signed a contract with your people to develop and exploit these lands,”</i> Ceranos said, waving a contract at Teelo.  <i>“If you break that contract, the penalties are very… prohibitive.”</i></p>


            <p><i>“You tricked Jarvik into signing that contract.  He doesn’t represent us!”</i>  Teelo complained.  <i>“All he cares about is his waterfall, and no one has seen him since he signed that contract!”</i></p>

            <p>Crokiak took the contract, and began to read it.  It was quite long.  Meanwhile Zoltano was ﬂipping through the book of rules, looking for the section on contracts while Teelo continued to argue with Ceranos about whether the contract was valid or not.</p>

            <p><i>“We are always open to renegotiation,”</i> Ceranos ﬁnally said.  <i>“Although some recompense will be required.”</i>  Teelo began to agree, but Crokiak cut him oﬀ.</p>

            <p><i>“No recompense will be given.  According to the contract, both parties can, at any time, demand proof of good faith in fulﬁlling their end of the bargain.  Failure to provide this proof invalidates the contract.  You promised that Jarvik’s waterfall would not be touched.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“We haven’t done anything to his waterfall!”</i> Ceranos protested.</p>

            <p><i>“But Jarvik has disappeared.  He is his waterfall and his waterfall is him.  Therefore you have violated your side of the bargain.  This contract is no longer valid.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“That’s preposterous,”</i> said Ceranos.</p>

            <p>Zoltano then appeared from the other doorway with the book of rules saying, <i>“When one side disputes the validity of a contract, a cooling oﬀ period of thirty days must occur.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“Who are you two?”</i> Asked Ceranos.  <i>“Neither of you look like you come from this plane.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“We are independent negotiators hired by the Lady,”</i> responded Crokiak.  <i>“We need not wait thirty days though, if you are willing to negotiate a new contract.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“Very well, we will be back in two days.  I must consult with my…people.  If you are not here though, then we will consider the original contract back in force.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“We will be here,”</i> said Teelo, who looked a little stunned at the turn of events.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>And with that, Ceranos and her cortège left, looking a bit more deﬂated than when they arrived.  The party quickly convened and discussed what they planned to do.  Verthandi and the others knew they were looking for something, and they hadn’t found it yet.  Teelo wanted them to follow Ceranos and ﬁnd where their stronghold was.  Crokiak wanted to go see Jarvik’s waterfall.  They quickly decided that following Ceranos was the best course of action.  Teelo left to tell the Lady of what occurred, while the rest headed oﬀ in the direction Ceranos went.</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, it was Verthandi who had to track Ceranos.  He had never been much on tracking, but he knew the basics, being a druid.  Unfortunately, he immediately lost her trail after only a few steps into the forest.  Thankfully the Drow pointed out a few burn marks and other magic telltales and they managed to get back on the track.  Bandito scouted ahead and behind to make sure no other creatures, nor Ceranos herself, discovered the party was following.  They almost walked into a some quicksand at one point after Zoltano insisted that devil’s love swamps, but were able to ﬁnally get to where the devils had gone and found where they were staying.</p>

            <p><i>“Now what?”</i> Asked Aldoon.  <i>“Do we sneak inside?”</i></p>

            <p><i>“I could,”</i> said Bandito, <i>“But I have my doubts about the rest of you.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“We could approach and oﬀer our services to Ceranos,”</i> said Verthandi, knowing what the answer to that would be.  But he felt he must at least plant the idea into the other’s minds.  Ceranos might be working for Enkosee, but she might also be an rival of his.  If they got whatever it was she was looking for, it might help them with Enkosee.  And if she was working for Enkosee, they could always remove her, recover the item, and still be rewarded by the Lady of the Tree.  Verthandi had asked for a few minds as payment, but wasn’t sure if they truly understood what he meant.</p>

            <p>In the end, they decided to head back, with a slight detour to see Jarvik’s waterfall.  Verthandi again led them to where Teelo had said the waterfall was.  They nearly walked into a nest of small dragonlike creatures, but it seemed they must have been getting used to the plane, as they deﬁed avoided that as well.</p>

            <p>Standing atop the waterfall, they looked out, considering what their next move would be.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 12 - Jarvik’s Waterfall</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Bandito (Chris Johnson)</em></strong>

            <p><i>God, will they ever be quiet!?</i> Bandito thought as he reached the peak of the hill. As he peered ahead getting a better view ahead from the elevation, his attention was immediately drawn to the wasteland. It was incredible. Vast. His awareness immediately piqued, instinctually aware of the dangers of this position, the lack of cover so close, and a great many eyes working in the waste.</p>

            <p>“So they weren’t kidding...” he mumbles under his breath as he gathers the rest of the view in front of him, he clearly sees a large waterfall much closer to him. The waste clearly begins not 50 yards from the waterfall like a line someone drew with a giant brown and black marker. The earth was being stripped away. Layer by layer. Nothing green anywhere to be seen that side of the line. Massive piles of trashed trees, brush, anything and everything in their way. <i>So this is what hell is about...seems fitting somehow...</i> He’d seen powerful men before. He hadn’t quite seen power like this, however... There was a part of him that was greatly saddened by the sight. He really was enjoying the lush forests, feeling so much at home for some reason. Even though he grew up mostly in waterdeep, there was just something about this place that captured his attention.</p>

            <p>As he studies’ the vision in front of him, he notices the cages near the edge of the Waste. <i>Well doesn’t that just look like something Feuriel and Aldoon would want to investigate and SAVE someone... I can’t handle a rescue, hopefully they won’t notice it. We need to rescue ourselves out here. Out on an errand boy’s mission that makes little sense to me, and clearly brings great danger to us. Here’s hoping we get the information we need, and get out of here.</i> While the Lady in the Tree had changed him, and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy his time here, he certainly didn’t want to stay here too long. He felt that Teelo would wind up using them for his own purposes. And Bandito doesn’t want to be anyone’s puppet any longer than he has to be.  If he can find his way to true freedom, this would be it. And the Lady in the Tree was the closest he has ever come to REAL POWER. So incredible - his memory of her visual and mental beauty inspires him.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p><strong>CRASH-crunch</strong> “OH! I’m so very sorry..” The sound of Aldoon crunching on a small tree, sidestepping it onto another branch and apologizing to the first was almost comical to Bandito.  “Come here, my large, loud friend, we must be careful or be seen by the enemy. See here...” and he points to the Waste. Aldoon’s friendly face whitens and immediately draws solemn, but Bandito knew he would need to make sure he hid Aldoon and the others.</p>

            <p>“Quickly: we must not linger here” he says to the party as they breach the hill. “Yes, there’s much to see here, but we must move to a position of more safety lest we be seen...and he points out the kobold tracks, flagging that there were kobolds that followed some kind of route - perhaps patrols!</p>

            <p>“I don’t see anything magical here, but I do wonder if that Sprite is even here” says Verthandi</p>

            <p>“Well they do seem to have been keeping up their end of the bargain unfortunately. Small infractions like encroachment probably don’t pose enough challenge to the contract to invalidate it.” Crokiak says sternly.</p>

            <p>“Shall we see if there’s a cave behind the waterfall - that’s where I’d look for one” Baloth chimes in. Bandito and Verthandi head off down a fairly narrow pathway down along the waterfall. Its wasn’t too tricky, but thankfully Aldoon didn’t stumble and fall on Bandito - he kept looking up at the shadow Aldoon cast, hoping that he wouldn’t. The big Elephant man seemed sure-footed in combat ... but there were times that Bandito’s risk senses were lighting up with every errant rock or pebble that moved down the hill. Once at the bottom, Bandito noticed that there was some space behind the waterfall just as the Drow had said. <i>Clever those drow... I don’t know a lot about them, but they’re always both creepy and scary, but knowledgeable - better a friend than a foe...</i></p>

            <p>Bandito and Verthandi were first into the cave, it seemed ... like a home. There was a table and chairs like a kitchen, a fireplace, even dishes, wall hangings of various kinds of trophies perhaps? Maybe art pieces the prior inhabitant found beautiful? <i>But no inhabitant. And ... hmm ... a crinkled up bunch of paper in the fireplace. At least it isn’t yet burned ... someone must have run out quickly, maybe we can learn more from the papers. There are a lot of trinkets and wait ... that looks like there USED to be something on those hangers ... maybe a spear and a bow? Hmm.</i></p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>As Bandito shares his assessment that the inhabitant left with a spear and a bow, and hadn’t been here for about a week based on the dust level and way things were left, the presumptions began to flow about when and why someone would have left so promptly. <i>Stealing? No, nothing of value, oh nice necklace, I don’t think he needs this...</i> “what are you talking about Aldoon...” he responds to whatever his big friend asked about whether he took a necklace, playing dumb...thankfully the big elephant left it alone. Bandito curses himself with his lack of attention to detail snagging that necklace. <i>You have to be better. But why would the prior inhabitant have left hastily but no sign of combat and so many lovely things still here...</i></p>

            <p>After a while of deliberating actions in the cave, Bandito heard something. He immediately hid and peeked out through the waterfall, and saw 7 kobolds coming up toward the waterfall. <i>There are 7 lizard men coning ... look relatively weak, but there are two bigger ones. I plan to attack from behind them, you all should strike fast straight at them so we can neutralize them quickly and with little alarm raised!</i> Bandito speaks to Baloth and Verthandi telepathically. <i>How are you doing that?</i> Verthandi says a bit surprised someone intruded his own thoughts. <i>I have my own surprises, must I share them all at once?</i> Bandito responds to Verthandi. Bandito swore he could see a smile behind the tentacled face as he peered over at the Illithid, and then himself dissolved to mist and teleported over behind a bush he could see behind the approaching patrol. Verthandi says to the others, “There’s a kobold patrol approaching, we must draw them in and attack and neutralize them quickly.”</p>

            <p><strong>SMASH!</strong> The sound of a dish breaking on the ground.</p>

            <p>And then a kobold peeks his head out of the waterfall and waves on to the approaching patrol.  <i>Kobolds behind the waterfall?! That has to be a trick... there’s no way they would have been able to get through the others tjat quickly...</i>Bandito thinks to himself.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>Bandito focuses on how these horrible creatures are really nothing, whispers under his breath, telling the lead kobold how he is really not worthy of being here, his mind is worthless, and he is doing to die. At that moment, he clutches his head, shrieks in pain, and falls to the ground, immediately dead. The other kobold patrolmen look at their downed comrade and are appalled, confusion and a bit of panic setting in, then look up and see an illithid step out from the waterfall point at them and more of their number drop and clutch their heads! This is not what they expected! Alert!</p>

            <p>There are bright white blasts, red blasts, the drow steps out making strange motions, and ultimately, all the kobolds but one are eliminated. The one kobold that seemed the leader was subdued magically, and seemed to be a friend Verthandi. <i>Such subtlety between friend amd dead woth that one...</i> Bandito thinks to himself. Even though Verthandi ate the brains of his comrade right in front of him. Bandito took note to stay out of his brain other than to just deliver a message, and stay close to him... keeping the brain scrambling in other heads seems the best option!!</p>

            <p>Once Verthandi learns from the Kobold that they have been searching for an item of great power, but he did not know what the item was, Bailoth and Verthandi come up with the idea of letting the befriended kobold “overhear” that we had the item, and had to report back to our Master... with hopes that the kobold would share some false information with his leaders and hopefully slow down the mining or perhaps some leadership questions with the best outcome being some kind of mutiny..</p>

            <p>They decided to head back toward the Stands and push through the night, not stay here. Too many dangers here. Bandito think<i>s...but the dangers on the way.....</i></p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>“Goodness gracious, Aldoon! Can you be ANY more LOUD?!” Bandito whispers from a bush to Aldoon... after an especially loud stumble and crunch...but they didn’t have much time to react - Bandito immediately heard noises from behind them a ways, but something or someone was closing on them.</p>

            <p>“Alert!” Bandito whispers to his comrades. The Broken Man asks us all to pack in together - Bandito gets way in close to the stone wall, and immediately he is drenched in a darkness he has never experienced. I mean it was dark before, but he could see the stars and the moons....now...pitch dark. He waves his hand in front of his face. Nothing. <i>Wow...this ... is interesting....</i></p>

            <p>And then, with his ears perked, he could hear the sounds of approaching creatures talking to one another. He couldn't tell what they were saying but it sounded like the kobolds they dispatched by the waterfall.  <i>I thought we would have put enough distance between us and there. No way that kobold we left was able to chase us down this fast...</i> he thinks to himself.  But woth little time before mayhem and the sounds of battle begin. Blasts and clangs of battle...but which way? <i>The sound of battle was to the southwest, perhaps I'll move south and find a space less dark....</i></p>

            <p>Bandito exits the darkness to see 8 kobolds to his right, but they were hard to see in this light, so he drew closer than he normally would care to and began tossing his psychic blades around.  The battle was chaotic. He did his best to keep hidden, but shortly after they seemed to be winning against the band of kobolds, he hears an alert call from Verthandi behind him, and turns to see blue lit dire wolves!  A whole PACK of them! And us trapped between! <i>Talk about between a rock and a hard place!</i></p>

            <p>Bandito was able to find some cover in the shrubs, but the blue lit moves were easy for him to target so he began to focus on them, poor Crokiak was hit hard amd both he amd verthandi disappeared into the darkness, but not before taking serious bites from those beasts.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p><strong>CCCCRCAAACCCKKKK!!!</strong><br/>

            The sound was deafening....but many kobolds fell to the ground, and then the wolves were on us! The elephant man was beside him, thankfully - he hadn't had a chance to hide again, so he was attacked, but as the wolves attacked Aldoon, he immediately fought back! Crackling lightning exploded from his hands, as he cast some sort of incredible spell, crashing into the fur of the wolf attacking him. The wolves’ fur seemed both steaming/singed while dripping with multiple colors ...the smell was horrible....but they were clearly furious and hungry, fighting for their lives just like we were.  And suddenly the balance pf this moment struck Bandito. <i>We aren't much different from these wolves...aside from THIS!</i> And as bandito hops away from danger, he tosses a glowing blue psychic blade straight up the nose of one of those horrid kobolds, completely evicerating his brain. As the body hits the ground, blood pouring from its ears and nose, Bandito smiled....<i>not EXACTLY the same, are we....</i></p>

            <p>It was at this moment this battle turned from even odds to a slaughter....the scenes Bandito could see were like nightmares, though heavenly nightmares....with the fallen angel showing her fury like he hadn't seen in some time, and literally slashing two kobolds clean in HALF!!  One of the kobolds seems to be on our side now and is attacking the wolves...and Aldoon continues to very very loudly exterminate the foes and blasts from the darkness flashing across the battle scene with enemies beginning to fall left and right all around Bandito. He smiles....this is starting to feel like power...power he wouldn't be controlled by, but power he could partner with...</p>

            <p>And through his smiling eyes, he saw the end of each of the enemies...<i>oh wait - there is a blue wolf running away!</i> FLIP - a blue glowing energy dagger goes flying across the scene...striking the wolf, and it falls dead. His small arms high in the air in victory. In his mind, though...as he was panting there...he knew they were closer to devastation than he cared for...<i>perhaps they should have stayed the night behind the waterfall...</i></p>

            <em>
                <p>Feuriel hadn't been herself since the Hell Hounds in the Scribery. If that can be said of a bipolar schizophrenic.</p>

                <p>Taken down by the ferocity of the infernal hounds, Feuriel came crashing to the floor of the scribery. She was plunged again into the dark gray void, reminiscent of her Fall from Grace. Her consciousness acquiesced. "What will it be this time?" she wondered dispassionately.</p>

                <p>And then she saw a bright light, beckoning her. Directly opposite the light, she saw a deep darkness. It too beckoned her, in a tantalizing manner. She turned toward the darkness, accepting its embrace, and yet it would not comfort her, for at that instant a powerful force pulled her from it, yanking her toward the light. It was Aldoon.</p>

                <p>She regained her sight. The benevolent loxodon was crouched over her as he completed his prayer of healing. He had saved her, and his Goddess Iolensis had allowed it. Was this a blessing, or a curse, that Feuriel should exist for longer in this wretched form in Hell?</p>

                <p>Her sight and consciousness had returned to her broken body, but Feuriel's mind--her soul if she could say she had one--had not returned. She stared blankly at Aldoon and got to her feet, saying nothing. Her eyes were glassy and her irises a pure black that matched her pupils.</p>

                <p>.....</p>

                <p>She remained in this trance-like state for days to follow. Her actions were mechanical, automatic. She said very little if anything to her companions during this time. It was as if she was under the control of some vast power, a being which used her--half-heartedly--as an instrument of his will, in a manner with little meaning or purpose.</p>

                <p>The automaton, Mel, had more life, more freewill, and more emotion than did Feuriel during this time. Although she accompanied her band of conscripts on their exploits into the fey realm, the fallen angel was distant and detached. She lacked the intensity, the fight, the moods, the conviction, that her companions had grown to expect from her. She had simply accepted her fate, having given in to the destiny that governed her.</p>

                <p>She lived only in the present, uncaring and unthinking, yet she relished the moments as her sword cleaved through the kobolds in front of her. Were they friend or foe? She didn't know. How did she get here, and was there a reason? She didn't know and she didn't care. Would there be consequences in the future? She didn't care.</p>

                <p>At length Feuriel would be feared or loved, appreciated or ignored, rewarded or punished. It mattered not at all to her. What will be, will be. Acceptance: the final stage of her grief.</p>

                <p>Searching no longer for truth or meaning, she found herself strangely free. Her awareness returned, and sharpened. The vacant blackness left her eyes, replaced with burning gold. She served a master again, and her master this time was her own self.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 13 - Aldoon and the Negotiations at The Stands</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Aldoon (Steve Graham)</em></strong>

            <p><em>“The winds will cool, and the mist will calm,<br/>
            the fog will conceal, and the rains will wash away blight…”</em></p>

            <p>Aldoon hummed a low brassy tone from his trunk as he quietly prayed and marched among his companions away from the wrecked landscape of the battle.</p>

            <p><em>“And even the stormcloud’s arc will be as a gentle kiss,<br/>
            that heals the wounds of the faithful and the faithless alike…”</em></p>

            <p>Occasionally, as he had been reciting this prayer over and over for the last 10 minutes or so, the barest flicker of electricity would emanate from him and dance over the party. It felt like nothing at all. A brief whisper from Iolensis that would caress a shoulder, a hand, the top of a head, before hopping away to the next plodding marcher.</p>

            <p><em>“Thus Iolensis, in her turn, restores and remakes,<br/>
            that the creatures of the world may gaze upon the sunrise of a new day.”</em></p>

            <p>In its wake, each who was touched by the softly crackling zephyr would heal a little more of the wounds suffered in the brief battle with the kobolds and the wolves.</p>

            <p>The fact that the prayer worked at all was one of the miracles Aldoon had been pondering for many days. On the one hand, he was traveling with a motley band that had a myriad of motivations - few of them truly righteous. He knew Verthandi in particular was taking opportunities to devour the occasional brain of a downed foe, and tried desperately to remember that it was the way of his people, perhaps even natural for him. It still made him sick to his stomach.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, he had never before felt the presence of Iolensis so strongly - never before been able to wield so deftly the divine energy that could heal or destroy. In recent days the words of the prayers came swiftly and easily to his mind, and the will of the Sister of Storms could be done even here, so far from home.</p>
            <p>His augury at the tiny shrine in Mithras had not yielded much, and yet the miracle perhaps was merely that the shrine was there! In this far away land - a place all but unreachable from his home - he had found a place to worship and connect with his patroness.  And as he meditated on the clouds, chanted the words, and asked his question, he did not stutter, he did not falter, the words of the Augury came easily. It was entirely different from his life in Erridon - he was entirely different.</p>
            <p>Perhaps he was meant to be here. He was meant to be in service to Enkosee. He was meant to meet and travel with Teelo to this wondrous land and see trees and sky and creatures of the land once again, and yes, even the little shrine to his Loxodon goddess. It was a little gift.  A message. <em>“You are where I need you to be. Stay true and keep going. You must see what I need you to see here.”</em></p>
            <p>He would remain watchful.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />

            <p>They camped for the night in a small hollow, concealed from the roads and paths - easily defensible. Aldoon awoke briefly - they were talking about hearing giggling somewhere beyond the campsite. Probably just dryads, nyads, or fairies, he thought. Aldoon nodded off again.</p>
            <p>He took the last watch and positioned himself to be able to see the sunrise. He wondered which divine power brought forth the sun each morning on this plane.</p>
            <p>As he watched the sky brighten, Aldoon prayed for guidance. He soon felt a quietness wash over him, a calm. He felt no urgency, no pull in any particular direction. He felt he was being told to wait. Be patient. See what you must see.</p>
            <p>A parable occurred to him of Guldorum of Hass. In the ancient days when Loxoda were regularly enslaved by elves and orcs and others, Goldorum withstood his slavery for ninety long years, watching and learning as much as he could of his masters’ ways. In the end, he used his knowledge and the favor of Eritrea and the Three Sisters to lead his people in rebellion and win their freedom. It is a story told to children to show how Loxoda are strong, patient, and persevere through adversity.</p>
            <p>But it also spoke of the need for understanding and nuance. It was through understanding the peculiarities of the slave-masters’ rituals and beliefs, that Guldorum was able to trick his way to advantage. It was written that he even grew to love them to an extent, even as he burned them with divine fire and trampled them beneath his feet.</p>
            <p>As the sunlight streamed through the trees and warmed Aldoon’s ears and face, he reflected that much was still a mystery to him about his plight here, his servitude. Likewise, Iolensis had chosen him for something, and he had much to learn from this journey before he would be ready to do her will.</p>

            <hr class="journal" />

            <p>They arrived at the Stands again and met with Teelo. There was discussion of contracts and battle plans. Teelo was only going through the motions. He had brought his own retinue of centaur warriors.</p>
            <p>The discussion turned to the object Cerranos was after, and when it was suggested that it could be another piece of the Fractum Ostium, something clicked in Aldoon’s mind. It seemed obvious that this was true, though it seemed they needed to be sure. The implications of Enkosee’s possible knowledge of, and involvement in the party’s being here on this plane raised more questions than answers.</p>

            <p>Cerranos arrived, and there was more talk. Aldoon watched from the shadows of a nearby structure. He cared little about the conversation. Teelo wanted an excuse to attack the caves of the invaders. Cerranos was buying time.</p>
            <p>As Aldoon watched he came to several conclusions. Teelo would march on the caves.  Nothing that happened here would change that. They had tried earlier in the day to convince him that was a bad idea, but he had not been convinced. He would lead his army to slaughter.  Aldoon pitied him and his soldiers, but he seemed to be getting bitterly used to tragic things he couldn’t control.</p>
            <p>Cerranos would not reveal anything about what she was after in the mines. She was here to continue the charade. No persuasion or machination would reveal an answer of what the object was to confirm the companions’ suspicions.</p>
            <p>It dawned on Aldoon that this was all distraction. All of it. Teelo, the Great Lady of Mythras, Cerranos, the waterfall keeper, all smoke and mirrors like a cheap charlatan’s show.  Aldoon had been brought here for some reason that had nothing to do with Teelo and his doomed quest, and whether it was Enkosee or Iolensis or some other infernal agenda, it all led to the object sought after in the mine. It was perhaps the only thing of any import, and the only way forward, the only way to find his way to his purpose was to get the object first.</p>

            <p>Aldoon finally saw his path, and a coldness swept over him.</p>
            <p>There were hundreds of minions working away at the mines. There would need to be something to draw them away so he and his companions could finish the search. Cerranos would need to be made to tell them what she knew, if she could even be so manipulated, and she would need to be made to call her minions away from the mines. Teelo would serve that purpose. He just needed a little push.</p>
            <p><em>“It is the will of Iolensis that I must pursue this course.”</em> he thought. <em>“It is why I am here on this plane, and why she speaks to me so clearly. Something in this is bigger than the defiling of the land and the subjugation of these people. I must clear the path. I am Her instrument.  Her will be done.”</em></p>

            <p>Aldoon glanced at Verthandi for a moment. <em>“How different are he and I really? We both do what we must in our way.”</em> He looked back at Cerranos and began to quietly recite the scripture.</p>

            <p><em>“And her fury broke,<br/>
                and the thunder cracked,<br/>
                and the very ground the apostates stood upon split,<br/>
                and the bodies of the enemies of the Iolensia were TORN ASUNDER.”</em></p>

            <p>The conversation was cut short by a tremendous, booming crack. Pieces of the wooden platforming of the Stands flew every which way. The force of it pummeled to death a few of the kobold soldiers, but Cerranos and her dog-faced minion survived. Aldoon stepped out from the shadows.</p>
            <p>The dog-man lifted his master and ran with her. As Aldoon had desperately hoped, the rest of his companions leapt into action.</p>
            <p>Aldoon heard the Broken man recite something in an arcane language and Darkness engulfed the remaining kobold soldiers. Verthandi, seeing Cerranos and her lieutenant making a break for it, cast a spell as well, and suddenly the dog-faced man stopped short, paralyzed.</p>


            <p>Battle cries sounded seemingly from everywhere as the Centaur soldiers emerged and engaged the bewildered kobolds. Teelo, freed from his indecision, leapt into the fray, slashing away, trying to get at their leader.</p>
            <p>Furiel descended into the fray on her blackened wings to absent-mindedly strike down a kobold mage. She shouted at Teelo to back off and lead his people. <em>“Leave the devil to us, you fool!”</em></p>
            <p>Aldoon pounded to the edge of the platform and recited his scripture again. Again, a great thunderous BOOM cratered the kobolds in the darkness. Dirt, bramble, and pieces of kobold went everywhere. As Aldoon marched forward, the darkness lifted. A bluish-green streak came from The Broken Man. One of the last of the kobold soldiers took the full force of the blast, and it tore a clean hole through its sternum.</p>
            <p>Aldoon heard Furiel’s cold voice, <em>“Stay right here and wait for my illithid friend.”</em> and out of the corner of his eye, Aldoon saw her drive her sword through the dog-man’s chest and into the ground, pinning him in place. As it expired, it began to slowly change shape back into that of a hell-hound.</p>
            <p>Verthandi descended upon its head.</p>

            <p>Aldoon could not see Cerranos. She had escaped somewhere in the confusion. That was not what he’d planned on, but Aldoon thought it might actually be for the best.  Teelo, energized by the battle, gathered his troops and charged away toward the caves.  <em>“Meet us at the caves! Today we rid the land of these infernal vermin!”</em></p>
            <p>That, at least, was to plan.</p>
            <p>Now, Aldoon thought, Cerranos retreats, gathers reinforcements from the mines, fortifies the caves. Teelo lays siege, and keeps them busy.</p>
            <p>Which leaves the mines open for Aldoon and his companions to search for the object and hopefully learn of its true significance.</p>
            <p>Aldoon felt calm. He had done what was required. In Ashuud’s letter to the Beldena, he says <em>“Lightning may bring fire, rain may bring landslides and floods, the ground may shake, the mountains may burst forth. This is but Iolensis washing away what is impure, that we may see clearly our purpose.”</em></p>
            <p>Aldoon was her instrument. He must do what must be done, here in these strange worlds. And he would go forth with a new understanding. That sometimes, to reach a righteous end, one must rain down fire.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 14 - The Ruin Of Mythras</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Mel Selene</em></strong>

            <p>
            The party had discussed the plan extensively. Teelo believed the negotiations with Ceranos had been a sham - a way to locate the enemy portal so his forces could destroy it. The party had agreed to scout ahead to support the assault.
            </p>
            <p>
            But something felt wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
            The cave entrance was guarded by a handful of kobolds, but the party did not enter. They observed from a distance, watching the tunnel mouths, counting the guards, assessing the defenses.
            </p>
            <p>
            There were hardly any defenses at all.
            </p>
            <p>
            They reported back to Teelo. The centaur captain listened, his expression growing darker with each word. Then he made his decision.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We attack now," he said. "Whatever they're hiding in there, we'll find it."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            And then Teelo looked north.
            </p>
            <p>
            A column of smoke rose from the direction of Mythras - thick, black, and unmistakable.
            </p>
            <p>
            "No," Teelo said. His voice was barely a whisper. "How?"
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel saw the realization dawn on his face. The empty cave. The minimal guards.
            </p>
            <p>
            There was no portal. There never had been.
            </p>
            <p>
            While he attacked an empty cave, Ceranos had been burning his home.
            </p>
            <p>
            Teelo didn't speak. He didn't rage at the party, didn't accuse them of betrayal. He simply turned and ran, his surviving centaurs following, racing toward the smoke.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            The journey back to Mythras was a blur of motion and dread. As they approached, the smell hit them - burning wood, charred flesh, something sulfurous and wrong. The protective hedges that had surrounded the city were gone, hewn apart and burned. The trees were blackened skeletons.
            </p>
            <p>
            Dead kobolds littered the streets. But something was odd - many appeared to have been killed by other kobolds, and some bore self-inflicted wounds. The density of bodies increased as they approached the town center, and a makeshift bridge of debris and corpses spanned the despoiled lake.
            </p>
            <p>
            And the Great Tree...
            </p>
            <p>
            It was gone. Not just burned - blasted apart, the stump torn from the earth, leaving a smoking crater. Kobolds dug in the churned soil, sifting through ash and earth.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Mel found Aldoon kneeling before a statue. The statue of Iolensis was somehow untouched - not even scorched, its stone pristine amid the devastation. The Loxodon's eyes were closed, his trunk curled around his holy symbol. Whatever he was feeling, he kept it private.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nearby, Feuriel stood before another statue - Torm, though it was barely recognizable. The elegantly carved oak had been warped and split by the heat, blackened charcoal exposed beneath, one eye still glowing with burning embers. Feuriel's face twisted with anguish as she looked upon it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then something changed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel watched as Feuriel's expression shifted - from despair to something else. Understanding, perhaps. Or acceptance. The fallen angel stood motionless before the ruined statue for a long moment, then turned away without a word. Whatever epiphany she had experienced, she did not share it.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Baloth was picking through the remains of a burned-out building - a magic seller's shop, from what Mel could see. The explosion had been violent, blown apart when the flames touched something volatile. But the Drow necromancer moved with purpose, his eyes scanning the wreckage.
            </p>
            <p>
            He found what he was looking for - a scroll case, blown into the branches of a charred tree. He retrieved it carefully, examined its contents, and tucked it away without comment.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Bandito moved through the devastation with a practiced eye, and Mel saw him pause, frown, look around. She understood his confusion. There were no bodies of townsfolk. No captives being led away. Just dead kobolds and burned buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Where are they?" she heard him mutter. "Where did everyone go?"
            </p>
            <p>
            It was a good question. And there was no one left to answer it.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            They found Ceranos at the crater's edge, shouting orders at the digging kobolds.
            </p>
            <p>
            She turned as they approached. Her expression shifted from annoyance to recognition to something that might have been satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Ah, it's you."
            </p>
            <p>
            She said something about her benefactor, about compartmentalization, about how the party's trail had led them to the object after all. Mel barely heard the words. She was watching the kobolds dig, watching them pull fragments of root and earth from the crater.
            </p>
            <p>
            They had found something. Something important.
            </p>
            <p>
            And then -
            </p>
            <p>
            That was when all hell broke loose.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 15 - Battle for Mythras</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Mel Selene</em></strong>

            <p>
            The kobolds ignored them.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel found that strange. The party stood at the edge of the crater, surrounded by Ceranos's forces, and yet the kobolds continued their digging as if the newcomers were beneath their notice. They pulled fragments of root and charred wood from the smoking earth, piling them carelessly, their claws working with mechanical efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
            The party joined the search. Mel moved among the kobolds, her hands sifting through debris alongside the others. She watched Bandito carefully - the Harengon moved with a casual efficiency that his eyes scanning the churned earth with practiced intensity.
            </p>
            <p>
            At one point, he paused. His fingers closed around something small - something that glinted with metal and clockwork. He straightened, his expression unchanged, but Mel noticed how his coat seemed suddenly heavier on that spot.
 his hand slipped into his pocket with fluid grace.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Observation: subject has acquired additional mass. Contents unknown.</em>
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Then all hell broke loose.
            </p>
            <p>
            They came from the north - Teelo and his centaur warriors, a company of elves with bows drawn, and something else. Something terrible. A ragewalker, a malevolent forest spirit, its form a twisted mass of roots and thorns and hatred. It moved through the burning ruins like a living nightmare, and where it passed, things died.
            </p>
            <p>
            They killed everything in their path. Kobolds. Devils. Anything that stood between them and the crater.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Threat assessment: extreme. Enemy force composition: centaurs x12, elves x8, ragewalker x1. Survival probability without engagement: 34%. With engagement: uncertain.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            "I know," Mel muttered. "I know."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            The party turned on Ceranos.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel didn't know who struck first, but suddenly the three-way battle was joined. The kobolds scattered, some fighting back, others fleeing into the smoke. Ceranos shouted orders that no one heard. The centaurs charged through the chaos, hooves pounding, glaives flashing.
            </p>
            <p>
            And they attacked the party too.
            </p>
            <p>
            Teelo had not forgotten who he blamed for this disaster. His warriors cut down kobolds and party members alike, their faces twisted with grief and rage. Mel raised her weapons, fighting defensively, trying to keep the centaurs at bay while watching for the ragewalker.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            She saw Baloth fall.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Drow necromancer had been holding his own, his staff of withering draining the life from kobolds, when the centaur warriors descended upon him. There were too many of them. He went down under a hail of hooves and glaive strikes, and he did not get back up.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Ceranos fell somewhere in the chaos. Mel didn't see who struck the killing blow - the battle was too confused, the smoke too thick - but she saw the devil's body crumple, saw the life fade from her eyes. And she saw Bandito move through the aftermath with that same fluid grace he had noted earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
            He passed near the devil's corpse, his movements somehow... heavier. As if something had been added to his pockets. His hand slipped into his coat and retrieved something from around Ceranos's neck - a necklace of gold clusters and ruby accents. He tucked it away without a word.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            Then everything happened at once.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mel heard Feuriel scream. She turned to see the ragewalker descending upon the fallen angel, its thorn-covered limbs tearing into her flesh. Feuriel fought back with sword and wing and fury, but the creature was ancient and terrible, and its wounds did not slow it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel fell.
            </p>
            <p>
            But her eyes were still fixed on Teelo - still fighting nearby, still killing, mortally wounded but not yet dead. His insides were no longer inside. His glaives moved on instinct alone, rage,</p>
            <p>
            Feuriel did not descend. She hung on - broken, bleeding, dying - and reached out with something deeper than flesh.
            </p>
            <p>
            A cloud of darkness erupted from her, coalescing around the centaur captain. Teelo's eyes went wide.
            </p>
            <p>
            The darkness wrapped around him, through him, into him. Mel watched as Feuriel drained his life from his body - not quickly, not gently, but with terrible, absolute certainty. Teelo's face contorted with horror - pure, absolute horror, as if in those final seconds he had seen something that terrified him more than death itself.
            </p>
            <p>
            He collapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
            And as his body hit the ground, it began to change.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel saw it. Mel saw the confusion flash across her face - her last thought before she finally let go. Her broken body crumbled, her essence descending back to Hell, leaving behind only questions.
            </p>
            <p>
            What had Teelo been? What had he served? And who had sent him here?
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
            There was no time to ponder mysteries.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Go!" someone shouted. "South! Move!"
            </p>
            <p>
            The surviving party members fled, leaving behind the burning city, the smoking crater, the bodies of their enemies - and whatever remained of their friends. Baloth ehad been slain, Feuriel was gone. Teelo lay coiled in the ash.
            </p>
            <p>
            And somewhere in Bandito's coat, Mel suspected, the second fragment of the Fractum Ostium waited.
            </p>
            <p>
            She ran. Her mechanical legs carried her swiftly, but her mind was already cataloging everything she had seen. The three-way battle. The deaths. The transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Data collection: extensive. Analysis: pending. Conclusion: insufficient information.</em>
            </p>

            "For once," Mel muttered, "we agree."
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 16 - Picking Up The Pieces</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Mel Selene</em></strong>

            <p>
                They returned to Hell carrying the weight of what they had witnessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baloth was dead. Feuriel was dead. The second fragment of the Fractum Ostium was secured - hidden somewhere in Bandito's coat. And Teelo...
            </p>
            <p>
                But death was not an escape from Enkosee's service. When Mel and her companions emerged from the portal back to Uman Yango, they were not alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Panulis met them in the hellish portal reception chamber. Large powerful devils stood guard, their eyes glowing with hostility, their forms filling the room with an oppressive presence. They glared at the party but said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baloth and Feuriel were there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Drow necromancer looked... frayed. The edges of his being seemed worn, as if the fabric of his essence had been weakened by whatever force had claimed him above. Feuriel's condition was worse - her dark wings seemed thinner, her presence dimmer, as if something fundamental had been taken from her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neither spoke. Both avoided the party's gaze. They were back in service - for now - but something had changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel understood that this was no accident. They had died, but Enkosee had claimed them anyway. Death was not an escape.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                Enkosee waited in his study. His expression was congratulatory - pleased, even - as if they had received good news.
            </p>
            <p>
                "As you know, I am somewhat a collector of rare curiosities," Enkosee said. "I had tasked another to search for this artifact, yet progress was slow. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you had taken the initiative."
            </p>
            <p>
                He gestured to a table before him - objects arranged on red velvet pillows, gleaming in the infernal light.
            </p>
            <p>
                "And here you are."
            </p>
            <p>
                Enkosee confirmed what the party had suspected. The artifacts they had found - the fragment beneath the tree - were pieces of the Fractum Ostium. A device of immense power, capable of bending space itself. Long thought destroyed. Scattered across the planes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then he said something that caught Mel off guard.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Since we are being open with one another, I must tell you that I too am a victim of this place. I have been trapped here for such a very long time. I too was betrayed by one I trusted. A profound injustice was done to me, and I intend to eventually set things right."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel studied him. The devil's expression was sincere - or appeared to be. He spoke of being trapped, of betrayal, of seeking freedom.
            </p>
            <em>Threat assessment: subject Enkosee exhibits emotional vulnerability. Probability of manipulation: 67%. Probability of genuine disclosure: uncertain.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                But Mel had spent a thousand years trapped in her own body, controlled by Modrons. She understood what it meant to want freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This device may well be my salvation," Enkosee continued, "indeed the salvation of all of us."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think this calls for a toast," he said, smiling. "Panulis, fetch the wine."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                The rewards were distributed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crokiak received what appeared to be a simple screwdriver - but Mel saw his expression shift when he examined the maker's mark. Something about it resonated with him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aldoon was given an iron mace. He seemed disappointed at first - a mace, for a Tempest cleric? - but then recognition sparked in his eyes. He had held this weapon before. Somewhere. Somewhen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Broken Man - Elusurm - was presented with a translucent gemstone. As Mel watched, it melded into his eye socket like it belonged there. He did not remove it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feuriel received a sword that seemed to hum with barely contained vengeance. Appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baloth would have received a staff of withering - a quarterstaff, decrepit and withered, that sapped energy from the arm until its wielder wrested control. He was not there to receive it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bandito was given a ring - small, unassuming, but Mel saw the way his fingers lingered on it. A ring of evasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Szulsto was presented with boots of speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verthandi received a tentacle rod - the illithid recognized it instantly, his tentacles curling with something that might have been desire.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                There was more discussion and research to locate the next piece. The party worked together, combining their knowledge, their research, their arcane and technical expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The conclusion was clear: they needed to find the clockmaker. Keller Tegya. Hidden somewhere in the Shadowfell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The clockmaker would be able to make sense of this, I'm sure," Enkosee said. "I had hoped to avoid their involvement in this, but it seems we may have no choice, short of knocking on the doors of the Primus himself."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You see, the clockmaker is a tad unpredictable. Very, very powerful. They are... not from this world. And they've not been seen in eons as far as I know."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The good news is that I do know where they can be found. The bad news is that the only way to get there is through the Shadowfell."
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                Enkosee presented two paths.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The good news is that I do know where the clockmaker can be found. The bad news is that the only way to get there is through the Shadowfell. And the only way to reach the Shadowfell is via the Astral Plane - or through the Material Plane. Each has its own set of problems."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Astral Plane.</strong> Travel by spelljammer - a magical flying ship. Fast but perilous. Vast expanses of nothing punctuated by pockets of violence and terror. Pirates. Illithids. Illithid pirates. Liches. The occasional dead god.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come to think of it," Enkosee mused, "it sounds rather exciting, doesn't it?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel's internal systems stirred. She knew these vessels. She had served aboard one for centuries, bound to its operations, her consciousness partitioned and repurposed by Modron overlords. The mention of spelljammers sent a cascade of memory fragments through her processes - starlight on silver decks, the hum of a spelljamming helm, the void pressing against the hull.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verthandi knew of these vessels too - in particular, the nautiloid, a living ship fashioned from mutated kraken, favoured by mind flayers. Crokiak's people had escaped on such ships long ago, splitting into the militant Githyanki and monastic Githzerai. Githyanki pirates were a fierce menace in the Astral.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Threat assessment: Githyanki raiders - high probability of hostile engagement. Historical data: they killed my crew. They nearly killed me.</em> Mel's optical sensors dimmed slightly as she processed the memory. The ambush. The screams.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The thought of Illithid nautilloids troubles me," Mel said finally, her voice measured, "but with Verthandi by our side, I have no fear." She paused. "As for the Githyanki... if we encounter them, it will be time for some long overdue justice."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Optimism index: cautiously elevated. Risk assessment: acceptable. Emotional subroutine: unresolved grief and anger detected. Acknowledged.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Material Plane.</strong> The one they all knew - humans, dwarves, gnomes, elves. Familiar territory. More likely to encounter trouble, but also more likely to survive it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The tricky part," Enkosee continued, "will be suitably motivating Manshoon into granting access to his portal. If you want to go this way, I can see what I can do to facilitate this."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel considered. The Material Plane meant dealing with Manshoon - a wizard of considerable power and questionable allegiance. It meant navigating political currents she had little data on. But it also meant solid ground. Familiar skies. A world where the laws of nature still applied, where gravity was constant and death was permanent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Comparative analysis: Astral Plane offers speed and directness but high combat probability. Material Plane offers familiarity but requires diplomatic maneuvering. Either path demands resources we may not have.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                She said nothing. The decision was not hers to make.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                She noticed him by his stillness. The Broken Man had seated himself in a corner of the chamber, eyes closed, deep in meditation. Some sort of ritual. Mel observed from a distance, her Modron sensors cataloguing his breathing patterns, the subtle shifts in his posture.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Subject Elusurm: attempting some form of arcane communion. Probability of success: unknown. Emotional state: isolated.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Time passed. Mel was not certain how much - her temporal processors had learned to let such things drift in this place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then Elusurm opened his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                And immediately flinched, grabbing his head, a look of intense vertigo crossing his patchwork features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel stepped forward, concerned. "Report status - I mean, are you -"
            </p>
            <p>
                But Elusurm wasn't looking at her. He was looking at the room. And the room, from his perspective, was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything was upside down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel stood on what he perceived as the ceiling. The furniture, the bookshelves, Enkosee's curiosities - all suspended above him, defying gravity. He tried to stand and felt his sense of balance revolt entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then he blinked.
            </p>
            <p>
                And the room was right-side up again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elusurm's eyes - one flesh, one crystalline gemstone - darted upward to the corner of the ceiling. To what had appeared to be a mineral outgrowth, natural stone formation, part of the chamber's architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only now it moved.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lizard. But not like any lizard Mel had catalogued before. Its body was crystalline in structure, translucent, refracting the surfaces it passed over - sulfurous yellow when crossing brimstone, rocky grey when moving over stone. It moved slowly, deliberately, descending from its perch on the ceiling with careful grace.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Classification: unknown. Composition: crystalline organic matrix. Magical signature: familiar bond forming.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Elusurm extended a hand toward the ceiling. The creature crawled onto his palm, then down his arm, coming to rest upon his shoulders. Its tail draped down one side of his neck, its head settling near his ear on the other. It seemed to savour whatever warmth emanated from the elemental engine that powered Elusurm's reconstructed body.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, softly, in a voice like wind through crystal, it spoke:
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not alone."
            </p>
            <p>
                Elusurm's expression shifted. Something cracked open behind his eyes - not pain, not quite. Recognition. Connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elusurm said nothing. But as he left the chamber, the salamander still resting on his shoulders, he walked differently. Lighter.
            </p>
            <h3 class="break">Week 17 - Setting Sail on the Silvery Seas</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Szulsto (Simon Pancoast)</em></strong>

            <p>Szulsto sat meditating on the ship deck, looking back at everything that had happened. So much had occurred in to last few nights. He had been tasked with following a new group of Enkosee’s slaves. He had hoped that they would be more competent than his previous group.  They had been to rigid, too unwilling to accept what was happening to them. This caused their sanities to crumble. Szulto had learned from their mistakes. He accepted what was happening to him. When one falls into a stream with a strong current, one does not escape it by swimming directly into the current. They must swim diagonally and with the current, slowly but surely making it to the bank.</p>
            <p>After Szulsto met up with the group, he discovered that they had been tasked with discovering parts of a powerful Modron artifact, the Fractum Ostium. One of the pieces they had found under a sentient dryad/tree creature who had seemingly sacrificed itself to attempt to protect the village it was in the center of. The other piece was inside one of the party members, Mel. He himself was given his own, independent task; to keep the party sane. Unfortunately, two party members, Furiel, the fallen angel, and Baloth, the Drow necromancer, died while recovering the artifact from the tree. Szulsto hated it when this happened, as this had a great chance of damaging the sanity of whoever dies and is resurrected in hell once more.</p>
            <p>The party, after receiving their rewards, was led by both Enkosee and Crokiak, the artificer, to the library to do research on the piece of the artifact they had found under the tree.  Szulsto, almost liked Enkosee. He respected his cunning and knew him to be a powerful being.  They discovered that there were more parts to find, and that they needed to travel to figure out more on the whereabouts of one of the parts.</p>
            <p>The party also discovered that the piece of the artifact they had found could be charged.  Szulsto discovered that he could charge it with Psychic energy, and Aldoon, the cleric of storms, charged it with his clerical powers. The artifact allowed those holding it to teleport a respectable distance, ‘Sssomething that the party would certainly be able to take advantage of,’ Szulsto thought. ‘At leassst it can be charged with Psssychic might, not jussst magic.’ After charging the artifact piece again, the party made the decision to travel by boat on the Astral Plane. Enkosee, being the horrible, clever being he is, employed the same Githyanki pirates who had raided and almost killed Mel and had killed her fellow sailors. They set out, going out into the Astral plane.</p>
            <p>Szulsto came out of his revelry, feeling his psychic powers returning and his mind becoming more cemented into his new reality. ‘Ssswim diagonally with the current’, he thought to himself. Sudenlly, Baloth shouted, “Something’s over there!” Everyone looked, and suddenly the crew of the ship turned around quickly and started sailing at top speed away from something… large. Some kind of blob racing towards the ship at an alarming rate. Szulsto reached out, finding the psyches of each of his fellow party members and sending them a quick telepathic message: “Sssomething isss coming. Prepare yourssselvesss.” Szulsto himself braced, readying himself for possible conflict.</p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 18 - The Psychic Storm</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Mel Selene</em></strong>

            <p>
                The alert came without warning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Szulsto's voice echoed through the ship - not spoken, but projected directly into their minds: *Sssomething isss coming. Prepare yourssselvesss.*
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel's combat subroutines engaged before conscious thought could catch up. She was already moving toward the rail, her optical sensors scanning the silver void.
            </p>
            <p>
                What she saw made her processes stutter.
            </p>
            <p>
                A mass of pink translucent... nothing and everything. An amorphous cloud that seemed to fold space around itself, tendrils extending and retracting like the breathing of some vast organ. It moved with purpose. It moved toward them.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Classification: unknown. Threat level: extreme. Composition: psychic energy matrix, possibly construct in nature.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The crew was already scrambling. Captain Kidic barked orders in Gith, and the ship's two ballistae swivelled toward the approaching horror. Mate Xokoth was loading bolts - Mel noted the faint shimmer of enchantment on the ammunition. Flaming. Acid. And something else - psychic dampeners, perhaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They must have encountered these before," Crokiak muttered beside her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Or they're just thorough," Mel replied.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Threat assessment: entity is attracted to psionic energy. Vessel contains Githyanki crew - naturally psionic. Party members Szulsto, Verthandi - psionically active. Probability of pursuit: 100%. Probability of engagement: 100%.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Psychic Storm closed the distance with horrifying speed.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                The first tendril lashed out like a whip made of pure thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                It struck the hull, and Mel felt it - not physically, but mentally. A screech of psychic static that made her vision fragment and her audio processors emit a high whine of feedback. Around her, she saw others grab their heads, stagger, cry out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ballistae fired. One bolt tore through the mass, trailing acid that hissed and dissolved into nothing. The Storm recoiled, then surged forward again, angrier now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Combat dissolved into chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel found herself fighting alongside the Githyanki crew - a strange inversion of everything she had believed about her existence. She had sworn vengeance on their kind. She had dreamed of watching them die. And now she was fighting to defend them.
            </p>
            <p>
                A tendril swept across the deck. Three Gith sailors were caught - lifted, thrashing, their minds screaming before they were hurled into the void. Two recovered. One did not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Storm pressed closer.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                It was in the third exchange that Mel saw her chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Githyanki - she had not learned his name, would never learn his name - was standing near the starboard rail, crossbow raised, firing bolt after bolt into the roiling mass. His attention was fixed entirely on the enemy. No one was watching him.
            </p>
            <p>
                No one except Mel.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Target of opportunity: acquired.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                She did not think about it. Did not deliberate. Her body moved with the precision of a thousand years of programmed reflex, her metal hand closing around his shoulder, her weight shifting, her momentum carrying them both toward the edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                She stopped herself at the rail.
            </p>
            <p>
                He did not stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Githyanki had time to turn his head, time for his eyes to widen in surprise, time to open his mouth to shout -
            </p>
            <p>
                And then he was gone. Falling into the silver void. Falling toward the Psychic Storm.
            </p>
            <p>
                His scream did not last long.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Target neutralized. Witnesses: none detected.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel turned back to the fight.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Storm shuddered. The combined assault - ballistae, spells, blades, psychic fury - had taken its toll. The mass was losing cohesion, its tendrils withdrawing, its movements sluggish.
            </p>
            <p>
                It had had enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a final pulse of psychic static that left half the crew staggering, the Storm peeled away into the void, retreating into the silver distances from which it had come.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Drakkaro was saved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three crew members were gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel felt nothing.
            </p>
            <hr class="journal">
            <p>
                The ship was damaged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not catastrophically - the hull remained intact, the spelljamming helm still hummed with power - but enough that Captain Kidic refused to press on without repairs. A day, perhaps two. They needed shelter.
            </p>
            <p>
                She found it.
            </p>
            <p>
                A rock. An asteroid, really - a chunk of primordial debris floating in the endless silver. Large enough to provide cover, stable enough to anchor the ship. Dead enough to be safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Or so we thought.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The captain ordered the ship brought alongside. Crew members secured lines, began the painstaking process of assessing damage. The party was granted leave to rest - or to explore, if they chose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel chose to stay aboard initially. Her systems needed recalibration after the psychic assault, and she had... processing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Event log: Githyanki crew member, unidentified, deceased. Cause of death: fell from deck during combat. Contributing factor: Mel Selene. Classification: combat casualty. Alternate classification: murder. Emotional response: ...inconclusive.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                She had killed before. In self-defence. In service. In accident.
            </p>
            <p>
                She had never killed for revenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The feeling was not what she had expected. It was not satisfaction - or if it was, it was a hollow satisfaction, an ache rather than a triumph. A thousand years of rage, and this was what it felt like to begin satisfying it?
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Analysis: insufficient data. Further observation required.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                While the crew worked, some of the party chose to explore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel joined them eventually - her processing was going nowhere, and movement was preferable to sitting with her thoughts. Crokiak came. Bandito. Verthandi, his tentacles twitching with curiosity. Two of the Githyanki - Qa'adas and Yloth - accompanied them, crossbows ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                The asteroid's surface was barren. Crystalline formations jutted from grey stone, refracting the ambient light of the Astral into prismatic patterns. There was no atmosphere here, but that was no obstacle to beings who had learned to survive in stranger places.
            </p>
            <p>
                They found the entrance almost by accident.
            </p>
            <p>
                A crack in the rock face that widened into a tunnel, carved rather than natural. The edges were too smooth, the angle too deliberate. Someone - something - had made this.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Intriguing," Crokiak murmured, producing a small device that hummed with arcanic detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                They ventured inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tunnel system was more extensive than it appeared.
            </p>
            <p>
                Branching passages led off into darkness, and at the first junction, the Githyanki peeled away to investigate. Qa'adas gestured vaguely - <em>we'll check these, you check those</em> - and then they were gone, their footsteps fading into silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The party continued forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                What they found made even Mel's processors pause.
            </p>
            <p>
                A chamber. Circular. Lit by some phosphorescent lichen that clung to the walls in patches of pale blue. And at the centre -
            </p>
            <p>
                A capsule. Sealed. Transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside it, suspended in some sort of green viscous fluid, was an illithid.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Classification: Mind Flayer. Status: dormant? Undergoing transformation? Data: insufficient.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The creature's tentacles drifted lazily in its suspension medium. Its body was... changing. Swelling in places, contracting in others. As if it were being remade from the inside out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verthandi approached the capsule. His own tentacles extended, almost reverent, and Mel saw his eyes close in concentration.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Psionic communication: initiated.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                She could not hear what passed between them - Verthandi's abilities far exceeded her own psionic receptors - but she watched his expression shift. Curiosity. Recognition. Something that might have been concern.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is... undergoing a process," Verthandi said finally, his voice soft. "A transformation. It has been here for some time. It says it does not wish us harm. It merely... waits."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel studied the suspended illithid. She had no love for mind flayers - few did - but this one seemed pitiable rather than threatening. A prisoner of its own metamorphosis.  For now.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Threat assessment: minimal. Entity is incapacitated. Probability of hostile action: near zero.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the chamber held more horrors - or more curiosities, depending on one's perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suspension tanks lined the walls. Inside them, small quadrupedal creatures floated - intellect devourers, their brain-like bodies twitching occasionally. Some tanks were occupied. Others were empty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verthandi's attention fixed on one of the occupied tanks.
            </p>
            <p>
                "May I?" he asked, to no one in particular.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before anyone could respond, he had detached the tank from its mounting, cradling it with surprising gentleness. The intellect devourer inside seemed to pulse with awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Observation: Verthandi has acquired an intellect devourer. Purpose: unknown. Risk: potentially significant. Action: none recommended at this time.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The party exchanged glances. No one objected. No one dared.
            </p>
            <p>
                They left as they had come.
            </p>
            <p>
                The illithid remained in its capsule, dreaming its transformation. The intellect devourers remained in their tanks - minus one. The Githyanki returned from their side explorations with nothing to report but empty passages and ancient dust.
            </p>
            <p>
                The asteroid was a mystery, but it was not their mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ship awaited.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <em>Mission status: ongoing. Next objective: Shadowfell. Current location: Astral Plane, adrift. Emotional analysis: unease. The illithid was not hostile. The intellect devourers were contained. But the empty tanks...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Mel filed the observation away and climbed back aboard the Drakkaro.
            </p>
            <p>
                The repairs would be complete by morning.
