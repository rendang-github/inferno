Do you choose to serve your lord faithfully, or do you rebel and work to thwart his evil designs?

            <h2>Character Creation</h2>
            <div class="stylecap"><span>T</span></div>his campaign is based on the core D&amp;D 5E rule set, however the multiverse is a strange place with a variety of magical and psychic effects which may afflict or assist the characters.

            <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>
            Characters are created according to the point buy system.  Characters start with <strong>38</strong> points.  Points can be spent improving ability scores, but the cost to improve a statistic increases substantially the higher it gets.  See table below.  Ability scores can also be reduced, giving players a small amount of additional character points to boost other statistics.
            </p>

            <p>
            Race and feat based ability score bonuses apply *after* the point buy, and as such are "free" as far as points are concerned.  However, a 1st level character may have a maximum ability score of 18 for any given statistic, inclusive of racial bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each time a character gains an additional level, an additional ability score point is gained.  This is in addition to any ability score improvement granted by the character's class progression and/or feats.  Unspent ability score points may be saved for use at a later time.
            </p>


            <h5>Ability Score Cost</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2 tcenter3">
                <tr><th>Ability Score</th><th>Initial cost</th><th>Improvement Cost</th></tr>
                <tr><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>n/a</td></tr>
                <tr><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>4</td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>

                <tr><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>-2</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>-4</td><td>2</td></tr>
            </table>

            The <em>initial cost</em> represents the character point cost to buy the statistic at character creation time.  The <em>improvement cost</em> is the number of points required to raise the ability score from it's current value to the next highest value.  The improvement cost is calculated based on the value of the ability score without the racial or feat bonuses applied.

            <div class="flavour">
                <strong>Grognak the Barbarian</strong> cares only for STR, CON, and DEX, so his player selects a starting score of 5 for WIS, INT, and CHA, giving him more character points to spend on his "important" ability scores, selecting 18 for STR and CON, and 16 for DEX.  The cost of Grognak's STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, and CHA add up to 19 + 19 + 12 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 38.<br/>Unfortunately Grognak was not smart, cunning, or well liked and later died after mistaking a large stone for a potato.  Had Grognak lasted until 3rd level he could have used those additional character points to improve his INT, WIS or CHA from a 5 to a 6, perhaps granting him the knowledge that the rock was not a potato, the common sense to not eat things you find on the ground, or the personality that would motivate people to assist him rather than point and laugh as he choked to an entirely avoidable death.
            </div>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            Alignment is real and has actual in-game consequences.  There are no innate disadvantages to any particular alignment, however managing your relationship with the other party members will be important.  You can be disagreeable, but working together will generally be in your best interests.
            <div class="img98"><img class="inline98" src="img/paladin_mask.png"></div>
            Furthermore, there are many places in the world where one might argue that a civilization or a place is predominantly good, or evil, lawful or chaotic.  Yet most of the time it is not the place itself that has an alignment, but the people and creatures that populate it.  In the outer planes this is not true.  The entire plane has an alignment, and is fundamentally good, or profanely evil.  The land and space within this plane might enforce a rules based order, or perhaps even preclude one!  This has a real in-game effect on the players and may be a boon or a bane.

            <h5>Plane Alignment Boon</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tcenter2 tcenter3">
                <tr><th>Player Alignment</th><th>Plane Alignment</th><th>Alignment Boon</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Lawful</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lawful</td><td>Chaotic</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Lawful</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>Chaotic</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Good</td><td>Evil</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Good</td><td>-1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Neutral</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evil</td><td>Evil</td><td>+1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Neutral</td><td><em>Any</em></td><td>0</td></tr>
            </table>

            These values are cumulative.  For example, a <strong>Lawful Good</strong> character in a <strong>Lawful Good</strong> plane will have a boon of +2.  A <strong>Lawful Good</strong> character in a <strong>Chaotic Neutral</strong> plane will have a boon of -1.  <strong>True Neutral</strong> characters never receive a boon or a penalty.

            <h5>Boons and Curses</h5>

                <tr><th>Alignment Boon</th><th>Effect Magnitude</th></tr>

            <h5>Character Level</h5>
            As characters progress and their personal beliefs become stronger, so too do the effects.  Effects at higher character levels must apply additional effects.

            <h2>Madness</h2>

            <div class="img97"><img class="inline97" src="img/insanity.png"></div>
            The multiverse contains many places and situations that challenge the characters understanding of the true nature of reality.  Observing and being subjected to unspeakable horrors can cause one to lose ones mind.  Conversely, characters that can hold it together under difficult circumstances can gain a better understanding of reality.  We call this grasp of reality sanity, and this is represented in game as a sanity value.  Similar to hit points, losing your sanity means losing you mind and your life.  Unlike hit points, sanity points are not an all or nothing proposition.  You can be at 1 hit point and be just as effective as someone at full hit points, however losing sanity points has in-game effects, as does gaining sanity.


            <h3>Sanity Points</h3>

            Each character starts with <strong>10</strong> sanity points.  Sanity points may be gained and lost during the course of the campaign.  Lose too many and your character's mental state may be brought to the point where they are no longer functional beings, the mortal equivalent of death.

            <h5>Sanity Point Effects</h5>
            <table class="green tcenter1 tleft2 tleft3">
                <tr><th>Points</th><th>Title</th><th>Effects</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>Lost</td><td>Permanent mental breakdown.  Roll a new character</td></tr>

                <tr><td>6</td><td>Certifiable</td><td>-1 to saves and skill checks.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>8</td><td>Disturbed</td><td>Insanity table roll for affliction.<br/><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td><td>Uncertain</td><td><em>hidden curse</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td><td>Clear of mind</td><td>Not afflicted</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td><td>Free thinker</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>16</td><td>Mental Adept</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>18</td><td>Mind Master</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>20</td><td>Enlightened</td><td><em>hidden boon</em></td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Sanity Checks</h3>
            A character's ability to resist madness is based on their deepest, innermost, personal source of inner strength.  For a warrior, this would be their usefulness in combat.  For a wizard, this would be their intellect.  For a bard person, this would be their ability to entertain.  A sanity check comprises of an ability score check on the prime requisite of their character class.  As prime requisite ability scores for character classes are ambiguous in D&amp;D 5th Edition, a player may choose either of the saving throw proficiency ability scores for their 1st level class.  Once chosen, this prime requisite for the purpose of making sanity checks is immutable for the remainder of the campaign.  For example, a player creating a Fighter may choose either <strong>STR</strong> or <strong>CON</strong> as their prime requisite.  A Cleric may choose <strong>WIS</strong> or <strong>CHA</strong>, etc.  However, once chosen it cannot be changed later.

            <p>
            The DM may require one or more characters to make a sanity check.  The player should roll a 1d20, add their Proficiency Bonus, and the Ability Score  modifier for their prime requisite.  If the total is greater than or equal to the check DC, the character passes.  If the character fails, they will lose one sanity point.
            </p>

            <h3>Regaining Sanity</h3>

            Lost sanity points can be recovered via a number of means, including:

            <h4>Inspirational (or Dirty) Deeds</h4>
            A character performing a exceptional deed strongly oriented toward their alignment.  Such deeds should be of a creative and uncommon variety, and would typically involve some substantial cost or risk to the character.  Successful completion of the deed helps the character reaffirm their self worth and ego, enabling them to regain some amount of control over their mental state.

            <h4>Inspiration Points</h4>
            A character can gain a sanity point by expending their Inspiration.  This only applys to DM awarded Inspiration and not other character derived forms.

            <h3>Affliction types</h3>

            Upon dropping to a sufficient sanity level to aquire an affliction, the player should roll 1d20 to determine what the affliction is.  Players are expected to role play the affliction appropriately, starting with mild symptoms, and getting progressively worse as their sanity decreases.

            <h3>Curing Afflictions</h3>

            <p>
            The only way to permanently cure an affliction is to raise your sanity points back above the level at which the affliction was obtained.  If the character's points drop below that level again, a new affliction is acquired and the player must re-roll on the affliction table.
            </p>
            <p>
            Players may use magical healing to temporarily raise their sanity points back to at most a value of 10.  Example spells which may help with this include <em>Calm Emotions</em>, <em>Lesser Restoration</em>, <em>Greater Restoration</em>, and <em>Heal</em>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <h2>Death</h2>
            The characters are bound into the service of the infernal plane.  As such, when reduced to zero hit points, the character does not fall unconcious, but is transported back to the Nine Hells.  This is an extremely traumatic and jarring experience to a character's psyche, and as such there are consequences to this.  A character "killed" in this manner must make a sanity check or lose a sanity point upon returning to Hell.
            <p>
            After having returned to Hell, the character may choose to wait for the other party members to return, or seek a way to rejoin the party based on the circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3>Resisting Death</h3>
            The player may choose to resist returning after being reduced to zero hit points.  For each round the player must make a sanity check.  On a successful check, the character remains as a <strong>Vengeful Spirit</strong> that can still participate in an unresolved conflict.  On a failed sanity check, the character will return to Hell as above, but will suffer an additional sanity point loss.
            <p>
            The stats and powers of the <strong>Vengeful Spirit</strong> will depend on the character's alignment, and will be revealed upon this condition occurring.
            </p>

        <div class="page">
            <h2>Character Race</h2>

            <p>
            Most campaigns take place on the prime material plane, where there is a fantastic multitude of available player races to play from the now standard elves, dwarves, and hobbits and other staples of classic fantasy fiction, to exotic minotaurs, lizard men, and demonspawn.  Yet this pales in comparison to the mind bending variety of possible player character races on the planes such as Genasi, Gith, Formians, and many more.  In this campaign, players will be able to create characters from any reasonable race, and maybe just some unreasonable ones!  Players can work with the DM to create a novel race around a particular idea to provide a memorable but balanced playable race concept.  The only type of being off-limits are those native to the Nine Hells.  Note that this does not include Tieflings, as they are native to the prime material plane.

            <h2>Monsters</h2>
            As the campaign progresses, the player characters will encounter exotic never before seen creatures.  Many of these creatures may be benign or even beneficial, most will be hostile, and some will test the very limits of the characters psyche.

            <h2>Magic Items</h2>
            Magic pervades the very essence of the planes.  Very often magic is captured into a physical form, perhaps by a deranged wizard for later use to gain an advantage over enemies or to achieve a greater goal, perhaps as a failed experiment tested and then later discarded by a lost and forgotten god, perhaps even formed naturally via a rare confluence of the elements and forces of the universe.  In any case, magic items add great power to the player characters, and are prolific throughout the planes.  The biggest question is where to find them, and how to liberate them from their owners without getting killed in the process...

            <p><strong>As played by Ben Pancoast</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/broken.png"></div>
            <p>
            I grew up in my family's estate with my aging aunt and uncle, their
            son, my cousin. My parents had left for a far-off realm to resolve
            an ancient dispute with another wealthy family.
            </p>
            <p>

            I was always an academic, bookish type. I spent my childhood
            looking at the tomes and scrolls and parchments, paintings and
            drawings, and obscure artefacts that lined the estate's shelves and
            walls, handed down through my family over ages. As I grew, and my
            aunt and uncle succumbed to their age, I perused the estate's
            collection with ever-growing scholarly curiosity. In time, I would
            devote my life to doing avid research, learning ancient tongues and
            seeking lost pages and relics, with a remarkable affinity for
            convincing erstwhile collectors of similar relics and writings to
            share them with me, sometimes even to keep.

            </p>
            <p>
            I studied, and I learned. But I never really believed in any of it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, my cousin was enjoying the best of life. With
            extraordinary popularity and easy charm, he hosted grand parties
            with guests influential, mysterious, or both. At court and in the
            merchant halls, he was content to squander the family's wealth on
            revelry, failing trades and shaky land deals. He would routinely
            ridicule and deride me, teasing "are you sniffing in those dusty
            scrolls again, cousin?"

            </p>
            <p>
            But behind his guise of irresponsible playboy, he believed all of
            it. And he never let on. His understanding of the importance and
            value of the tomes and artefacts surpassed mine, and in truth, his
            apparently shaky deals secretly advanced a dark agenda. But he
            lacked the discipline and scholarship to comprehend the most arcane
            of family's eldritch treasures. I could comprehend the storied
            arcana, but I did not understand. I did not or would not see. This
            blindness would become my undoing.

            </p>
            <p>
            Eventually, my cousin pretended to take a passing interest in my
            studies. Feigning disinterest, he elicited, "Tell me what the big
            deal is with all these, with all of this. You've wasted so much of
            your life on them."

            </p>
            <p>
            "Start with, um... Oh, how about that one?"

            </p>
            <p>
            And so one day, I shared, and I began to read aloud. And to
            demonstrate.

            </p>
            <p>
            But though I believed I was academically explaining the tomes and
            scrolls, I was unwittingly working through dark, arcane rituals. My
            cousin's interest wasn't feigned at all, and his cohort of fellow
            believers were hiding nearby in our estate, an estate
            purpose-built, which concealed chambers and sigils for just such an
            occasion. And so, my fall:

            </p>
            <p>
            <em>
            I finally reach the end of the recitation, and my cousin asks, "So,
            now what happens?"

            </p>
            <p>
            And I answer, "well according to the text, there would need to be
            some sort of betrayal and sacrifice. Whatever that means."

            </p>
            <p>
            "I think it means this, cousin," he sneers.

            </p>
            <p>
            And he looks into my eyes as he plunges an accursed dagger into my
            heart.

            </p>
            <p>
            As the light begins to fade from my eyes, and the forces of evil
            cackle with glee at their newest sacrifice, I find determination
            enough to choke out "You knew? You knew all along??? Why?  Why
            cousin?!?"

            </p>
            <p>
            "You see, cousin, a trade must be made to summon power here. Thank
            you. Truly."

            </p>
            <p>
            A portal to Hell begins to open, and the ritual continues that will
            allow a devil-spawn to take my place in the mortal realm, as I take
            its place in Hell.

            </p>
            <p>
            This final ritual, a missing link written on an ancient scroll kept
            hidden from me for all these past years, requires the creation of a
            Hellish torment in the mortal realm. And so I am wrenched back to
            consciousness and made to suffer through unknowable hours of
            Hell-worthy torture: skin is flayed from my flesh, flesh carved
            from my limbs, limbs torn from my body. When at last the torment is
            adequate, and the portal is stable enough for the transfer, the
            cursed dagger that trapped me in near-death during my agony is
            withdrawn from my heart and drawn across my throat.

            </p>
            <p>
            And as I fade from consciousness, with the last remaining drops of
            my lifeblood spattering into the sigils on the floor, I gurgle
            "Gods forgive me; what have I done!? Someone, something, please,
            spare me this fate, and give me a chance to right this wrong..."

            </p>
            <p>
            Fatally betrayed by my own kin, I feel myself hurtling down toward
            eternal damnation, pummeled by debris and fragments of the ritual
            chamber and its furnishings that were drawn through the gaping
            portal with me.

            </p>
            <p>
            Passing through plane after plane of different overlapping
            realities, I approach my destination, and I plummet toward a sea of
            tortured agonized souls, their screams in eternal pain reaching up
            toward me, joining my choked bleats of terror. What little remains
            of my body starts to disincorporate, tattered remnants of flesh and
            bone sear away as my fall approaches its end.

            </p>
            <p>
            And then something answers.

            </p>
            <p>
            The unseen presence of some vast cosmic power says deeply in my
            mind "very well, mortal."

            </p>
            <p>
            As the sound of the voice trails off, darkness rises around me,
            muffling the cries from Hell below.  The shards and remnants from
            the ritual chamber start to stick to what remains of my shattered
            corpse. There is a moment of intense, wrenching vertigo. And then
            all is darkness.

            <h3 class="break">Bandito - Gransalto's Story</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Chris Johnson</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/bandito.png"></div>
            <p>
            Born into a large Harengon family living on the outskirts of
            Waterdeep, this bunny-kin was the runt of the litter.
            Interestingly, his leap was greater than the rest of hte litter,
            earning him the name Gransalto ("Big Leap"). One day, when he was
            still very young, a group of thugs working for Xanathar, the
            infamous beholder who controlled much of the criminal underworld of
            Waterdeep, raided Gransalto's home and kidnapped him. The carnage
            of the harengon was abominable. They tormented and burned the homes
            of the harengon, and raided and took anything of value. Curiously,
            one of the bandits found poor Gransalto attempting to hide in a
            small nook in a cave. Upon being discovered, Gransalto leaped his
            biggest leap, and attempted to escape, but the raiders were too
            many, and ultimately, he was captured in a bag, to be brought back
            to Xanathar as a gift for his entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gransalto was forced to perform dangerous stunts to entertain
            Xanathar. And eventually, as Gransalto earned some level of trust
            with his captors, and worked to earn his way to more valuable
            tasks, they gave him jobs of thievery and message delivery, and
            even more unsavory tasks by some of Xanathar's criminal associates.
            Over time, he became more skilled in these unsavory arts and was
            even given the nickname "Bandito" by Xanathar, which they all began
            calling him. Unfortunately it started as a gag, teasing him with
            the sing-songy sound of his given nickname of his parents, but
            ultimately, it gave him purpose, and helped him fit in... so he
            went with it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite being forced into a life of crime and servitude, Bandito
            never forgot his desire for freedom and a better life. He secretly
            worked on perfecting his thievery and sword and dagger skills,
            hoping to one day steal enough to escape and fight for freedom to
            live a peaceful life. As Bandito grew older and proved himself
            harmless to Xanathar, he became increasingly trusted by him and was
            given more dangerous tasks to perform. He despised the life he was
            living but knew he had to continue to do what it took to survive
            and one day earn his freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
            One fateful evening, Xanathar, in an effort to keep his friends
            close, and enemies closer, invited all the major crime bosses in
            Waterdeep for a poker game. Manshoon, the most powerful crime boss
            other than Xanathar was a particularly special and important guest.
            Xanathar guild and Manshoon guild had been in a careful stalemate,
            but Xanathar had a plan to usurp his power in the midst of this
            poker game, and rob Manshoon while keeping him occupied with the
            poker game. The tensions and stakes continued to rise until
            Manshoon pressed Xanathar for a raise which he could not back away
            from, and put in a commitment chip, indicating his loyalty to
            Manshoon. The room went quiet. Could this be the Xanathar offering
            a partnership with Manshoon? How could he possibly open himself up
            to be subservient to Manshoon!? When the cards landed, and it
            appeared Xanathar lost, it was revealed that it was not, in fact,
            the Xanathar commitment chip, but Bandito's commitment chip he had
            put in. Manshoon smiled evilly, having become aware of the emerging
            strength of life Bandito represented, and knew this would satisfy
            his Patron. Manshoon smirked at the Xanathar, thanking him for his
            offering, and reminding him that Manshoon sees all, and that the
            attempted robbery was thwarted, reminding Xanathar of his
            weaknesses and Manshoon’s strength. With a smirk, Manshoon spins on
            his heels, grabs Bandito, and saunters out of the room.
            </p>
            <p>
            The discovery of Manshoon’s trickery infuriated Xanathar - which is
            something Bandito had seen before, but this dance had been
            carefully orchestrated, and to lose to Manshoon at this point would
            surely have left Xanathar in a fury like no other. Bandito watched
            the ritual knife thrust down into his chest, and wondered if this
            change would present him in some way, a new way to find his freedom
            and a better life…
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Verthandi - A finder's tale</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Chris Sweitzer</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/Verthandi.png"></div>
            <p>
            Fenrir the Finder stumbled out of the hospital on uneasy legs. Bile
            rose up in his throat, forcing him to stop to steady himself
            despite his desire to get away as quickly as possible. He had never
            seen such a monstrosity before, but that wasn’t even the worst
            part. It spoke. And what it told him frightened him more than
            anything he had ever experienced before in his life.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir found people. He was very good at his trade, having found a
            total of sixty-three people so far out of a total of sixty-four
            attempts. That one failure, early in his career, used to bother
            him, but no longer. It was that failure, and the elimination of his
            perfect record, that drove him to accept more chancy, and therefore
            more lucrative, opportunities, and he hadn’t messed one up yet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Usually the person he was looking for was simply in hiding from
            whomever was seeking them. A little legwork, a few spells, and he
            could verify and deliver the location of the absconder to his
            employer. This one, however, was different. He knew that from the
            beginning. He should have turned it down. He would have, had he
            stopped worrying about his unbroken streak. There had been similar
            offers in the past that he had rejected, before his failure. Even
            afterwards there were some jobs that he knew were impossible, or
            that he knew would end up with the person he found murdered by the
            person seeking them, that he declined to take.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was the druids. That’s why he took it. His one failure had been
            when he was looking for a druid. And now he was doing it again,
            trying to find a druid. And not just any druid, but the second
            highest ranking druid in the Druidic Circle of Infinite Rainbows,
            the most well known group of druids in the entire region. Druids
            have a reputation of being wool-headed, thinking about butterflies
            and flowers, but he knew better. Nature was as cutthroat as any
            back alley gambling den.
            </p>
            <p>
            The job had started innocently enough. He received a request to find
            Kenrik the Many, who was known for his ability to take the form of
            a staggering number of animals, from the Hierophant himself. Kenrik
            was the Hierophant’s right hand man. He was the one who did most of
            the work, while the Hierophant contemplated humanity’s place in
            nature, or so the lower ranks of the circle suggested.
            </p>
            <p>
            Not that he actually met the Hierophant. He wasn’t nearly important
            enough. He had met with some rank and file druid by the name of
            Tumeric at Kenrik’s home at the compound that housed the
            high-ranking druids of the Circle of Infinite Rainbows, which was
            the last place the errant druid had been seen some six weeks
            earlier. Of course it wasn’t strange for someone with the
            responsibilities of running the day-to-day operations of the circle
            to be away for months at a time, but he had been expected to meet
            with the Hierophant for their yearly conference on the state of the
            circle a week earlier and yet was nowhere to be found.  Attempts to
            communicate magically to Kenrik had failed, attempts to magically
            locate Kenrik had failed, and now the Hierophant wanted to know
            where his second had gone off to and why.
            </p>
            <p>
            Walking into Kenrik’s home was the first warning sign. Fenrir had
            the uncanny ability to walk into a place and immediately know what
            was important and what was superfluous. There were differences
            between the home of someone who had been kidnapped and someone who
            had fled. But Kenrik’s abode had neither. There were no signs of
            struggle. There were also no signs of someone who had left of their
            own accord. There was absolutely nothing. Actually, it was worse
            than that. The entire home looked staged. All homes, whether lived
            in or not, have something out of place. They have something askew
            or missing. This place was perfect.  Everything was where it should
            be. Everything looked completely normal. It was disconcerting to
            Fenrir. He should have thanked Tumeric and left right then, but he
            didn’t, and truth be told, it was because he was afraid what people
            would say if he failed to find a second druid. “Don’t hire Fenrir
            to find druids,” people would say. He knew it was silly, but then,
            people were fickle, and finding people was his livelihood.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since Kenrik’s house provided no clues, and magical means turned up
            nothing (not that Fenrir didn’t try, even though the druids had
            already done much more than he could muster),he consigned himself
            to doing the job the hard way. In order to find out where Kenrik had
            gone, he had to find out where he had been. Kenrik travelled all
            around the region to visit with the various druids of the circle.
            And so Fenrir did the same. And that’s where the job went from
            disconcerting to disquieting. None of the druids had met with
            Kenrik lately. Some of them hadn’t seen him in five years. Some
            hadn’t seen him in eight. Some had never met him at all, but only
            remembered his predecessor. It didn’t seem possible or plausible.
            How could Kenrik had met with the Hierophant every year and told
            him what the circle was doing if he wasn’t meeting with the
            circle’s members? What exactly was Kenrik doing when he travelled
            around the area if he wasn’t meeting with members? Where was he
            going?
            </p>
            <p>
            Since Kenrik wasn’t going to where druids were, he had to be going
            where they weren’t.  Druids spent most of their time in nature.
            They lived in forests, in swamps, high on mountaintops, or deep In
            valleys. They didn’t live in cities. So that is where Fenrir went.
            He thought it was a long shot. After all, why would a druid go to a
            city? But he immediately found that’s exactly where Kenrik had
            gone. And not just one city, but every city. Every place where more
            than a few people gathered and lived together he found that Kenrik
            had visited. And now the job wasn’t disquieting anymore. In fact,
            it screamed at him to get out and run away as fast as possible. But
            it was too late. He had spent too much time, and too much money, to
            give up. And the job had its hooks into him now. He had to find out
            what Kenrik was doing, and the only way to do that was to find him
            and ask.
            </p>
            <p>
            Kenrik had been meeting with every magical guild in every major
            city in the region. It wasn’t just some of them. It wasn’t even
            most of them. It was all of them. As the second ranking member of
            the most powerful druid circle, they all had no problem opening
            their doors to him. And what harm could it do? He was just a druid.
            </p>
            <p>
            It appeared, at first glance, that he was just doing research into
            druidic matters. Every magical guild and group had their libraries
            and archives, and Kenrik would spend time in each.  Most kept track
            of which books and papers the druid looked at in order to make sure
            that if he found anything of interest, they would know where it was
            he had been looking.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was all books about nature and herbs and animals. Exactly what
            one would expect from a druid. There was nothing out of ordinary
            about the books, except that every single one was one that Fenrir
            had seen before. He had seen them in a very specific place. He had
            seen them in the home of Kenrik. Kenrik was doing research in books
            that he already owned. It made no sense. Only, it did to Fenrir.
            Kenrik was looking for something specific, but needed to hide what
            he was looking for. So he spent time looking at books he had
            already read to mask what he was really looking for. And what he
            was looking for wasn’t a book, but a place.
            </p>
            <p>
            At first he thought every book was one Kenrik already owned, but
            after traveling back to Kenrik’s home to check, he found that
            wasn’t the case. There was one book that showed up in the list that
            wasn’t in Kenrik’s home library. It wasn’t anything special. It was
            simply called “The Healing of Curses.” It wasn’t even a rare book.
            He found a copy in his home city and read it cover to cover. There
            was nothing in it that was particularly novel or eye-opening. But
            Fenrir knew there had to be something about that book. Kenrik must
            have been trying to figure out how to lift some kind of curse, but
            if so, the contents of that particular book would not have been
            much help. It was rudimentary. Any hedge wizard or cleric could
            probably do everything described in the book. Even Kenrik probably
            knew more about healing.
            </p>
            <p>
            If it wasn’t the contents of the book, Fenrir thought, it had to be
            the origin. The book was written by a cleric, of course, who
            resided at a hospital that specialized in difficult to cure magical
            diseases. Fenrir had actually heard of it. It was situated in a
            remote region away from any major city, which made sense. People
            worry about diseases from such places getting into densely
            populated areas, and they had to be built where few people lived.
            There was a nearby town, of course, but it didn’t even have a
            hundred people in it.
            </p>
            <p>
            And so Fenrir decided to travel to this town and the hospital that
            had been built on its outskirts to find anything about the druid he
            had now spent several months looking for. The town itself was
            nothing special. He stayed at the only inn. Everyone was very nice.
            No one remembered seeing a druid showing up in the past half year,
            but then, he didn’t expect that they would. The hospital looked
            exactly as he expected. It was a big imposing building with few
            windows, but a pleasant demeanor. And with every step he took up
            the main steps, he felt his gut tighten. He felt the same feeling
            he felt when first looking at Kenrik’s home. He walked inside and
            was met by a kind young priest who asked him what ailment he was
            afflicted by and how they could help. When he explained who it was
            he was looking for, expecting either a denial of their existence or
            at least refusal to acknowledge their admittance, he was surprised
            by the young man’s response. It was sadness. Kenrik was there. In
            that very hospital. But they had, so far, been unable to help him.
            Somehow Fenrir expected it to be harder. And when he asked to see
            him, the priest readily agreed to take him. In hindsight, he should
            have known something was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
            Most druids, apart from the most remedial, can turn into animals.
            Kenrik was the foremost expert at doing so, except maybe for the
            Hierophant himself, although he never appeared in public anymore,
            so no one really could compare the two. The creature that lived in
            Kenrik’s hospital room appeared to be made from every beast that
            Kenrik could transform into.  It wasn’t just a chimera, made of a
            few different animals, but a gestalt of nature. Every limb, of
            which a dozen sprouted from Kenrik’s torso, was made from several,
            if not hundreds of different creatures. Scales and feathers
            sprouted like wild grass from every exposed piece of skin. Talons
            and claws and hands and paws grasped and clasped, ripping and
            tearing at itself in a grotesque menagerie. The torso was still
            human, but heaved and groaned with animal faces covering it, all
            moaning and screaming, but without sound. In fact the whole room
            was deathly silent except for the scraping of skin as a nail or
            claw scratched against skin, opening new wounds on top of
            half-healed old ones.
            </p>
            <p>
            And there was blood everything. The priests had obviously tried to
            keep the druid clean, but the constant scratching and biting and
            thrashing caused a constant spray of blood that covered every
            nearby surface in the room. No doubt some of the blood was from the
            priests who got too close and accidentally slashed by a flailing
            arm or leg.  And despite all of this. Despite all the horror of
            Kenrik’s body, what truly disturbed Fenrir the most was its head.
            He had been given a portrait of Kenrik, so he knew what he looked
            like. And there was no doubt that the head upon this creature was
            that of Kenrik’s. But where one would expect to see a visage of
            pain and horror, was one of quiet contemplation.  Despite the
            seething limbs and gnashing faces covering his body, Kenrik looked
            as serene as if he was sitting by a river enjoying a light breeze
            off the water. And as Fenrir approached, his eyes opened and he
            looked at Fenrir and he said, “Hello Fenrir. Good to see you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir went back to his room at the inn after leaving the hospital.
            He must have, since that’s where he found himself, although had few
            memories of his walk back from the hospital.  He was still having a
            hard time processing what Kenrik had told him.
            </p>
            <p>
            “I knew you would find me,” Kenrik had said, as calmly as if he was
            discussing the weather.
            </p>
            <p>
            “How?” Croaked Fenrir.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Who else would he send to find me? You are the best at what you
            do.” Kenrik had explained.
            </p>
            <p>
            “What do you mean?” Asked Fenrir. “Who do you think sent me?”
            </p>
            <p>
            “The Hierophant, of course.” And for the first time, Fenrir saw
            emotion pass over Kenrik’s face. A look of disgust and fear
            appeared, but only for an instant. Most of would missed it, but
            Fenrir missed very little, even in his current state.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Well, yes,” Fenrir explained. “He did send me, although I never
            actually met with him.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “Better that you hadn’t. Very few meet with the Hierophant and
            emerge unchanged, as you can see by my current predicament.” Fenrir
            was stunned. Kenrik’s curse, and that’s what it had to be for him
            to be here, was caused by the Hierophant? Continuing, Kenrik said
            “That is how he keeps us in line. It’s how he keeps us from
            betraying his secret.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “His secret?” Fenrir was perplexed. What was Kenrik talking about?
            </p>
            <p>
            “Yes, his secret. And now that you’re here, I can reveal his
            secret, and finally be cured of this curse, or die in the attempt.
            You can go back and reveal it and the Hierophant’s reign of horror
            will finally be at an end.”
            </p>
            <p>
            The attempt to remove Kenrik’s curse was scheduled for midnight
            that very night. But Fenrir had no plans to stick around for it. He
            wasn’t even going to be in town by that time. He wanted to get as
            far away from the hospital and the Hierophant as possible. The
            secret Kenrik had spoken to him had been very simple, but it had
            chilled Fenrir to his very core.
            </p>
            <p>
            “The Hierophant is a mind flayer.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir was no hero. He was no adventurer who slew monsters by the
            dozen. He had heard of the Nine, who had killed a mind flayer
            almost as an aside while also slaughtering two dragons and a dozen
            dark dwarves and their allies, but to him, the Illithid were
            creatures of nightmares who would suck out your mind and leave you
            a husk. He had to get away. He had to escape this place before the
            Hierophant found out where he had gone. But it was already too
            late.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Hello Fenrir,” a new voice said from behind him. “Good to see
            you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            The next morning a maid screamed after she opened the door to
            Fenrir’s room and found him sitting in a chair, a smiling grimace
            on his face, the top of his skull removed, and nothing but
            emptiness inside his head.
            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi, better known as the Hierophant, headed quickly towards
            the hospital where Kenrik was. He had consumed Fenrir’s thoughts,
            and his brain, so he knew Fenrir hadn’t had the opportunity to tell
            anyone his secret, but if these priests managed to cure Kenrik of
            the curse Verthandi had laid upon him, then he could still reveal
            it to everyone else in the circle, and Verthandi would be ruined.
            It had taken decades to subvert and take over the circle, and now,
            just as he was about ready to have his improved beasts, Verthandi
            refused to call them aberrations like other did, supplant the
            generic creatures of this world, he couldn’t lose his most powerful
            tool. Kenrik had to die, as did the priests of the hospital where
            he lay.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fenrir’s thoughts still swirled through Verthandi’s head, as always
            happened after a meal. He was impressed by the young man. He had
            been observant and quick witted. Very few would have found Kenrik’s
            hiding place. And even fewer would have seen it for what it really
            was.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s an odd thought, pondered Verthandi. He was through the front
            doors of the hospital by now, tearing apart the priests who
            attempted to stop him. He also consumed their brains, but they were
            simpletons. What had Fenrir seen that so disturbed him?
            </p>
            <p>
            More priests appeared, only to fall to Verthandi. He arrived at
            Kenrik’s room, but they had already moved him. Thanks to the
            informed gleamed by the minds of the priests Verthandi had
            consumed, he already knew they had taken him to a chamber beneath
            the hospital, where the true work was done.
            </p>
            <p>
            True work? Verthandi thought. The removal of curses was their work.
            Why am I thinking about their true work? It was Fenrir, he
            realized. Fenrir had seen this place, and it had disturbed him. It
            wasn’t Kenrik’s appearance or even Verthandi’s secret that had so
            unnerved the man. It was this hospital. Maybe not on a conscious
            level, but there was something about this hospital that was wrong.
            It wasn’t a place a healing. It was something else. It was a place
            of suffering. Verthandi burst into a large chamber. Kenrik was
            strapped to a table in the middle, surrounded by thirteen priests.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Hello Verthandi. It’s good to see you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Kenrik had sold his soul. And he did so gladly, to protect his
            circle, and the world, from the alien horror that the Illithid who
            had supplanted the previous Hierophant represented. The priests of
            this hospital—he laughed. It was no more a hospital than the
            Hierophant’s aberrations were “improved beasts.” These priests were
            devil worshippers, or maybe even devils themselves. And now they
            had what they wanted. One of the most powerful druids in the world.
            Not him, of course. He was powerful indeed, but he offered them
            something greater. An Illithid druid. A hierophant. And not just
            its soul, but its entire being. Sure, he would die, and spend
            eternity in torment, but it was worth it to protect that which he
            loved.
            </p>
            <p>
            “He almost figured it out,” said Verthandi. “He saw what this
            hospital really was, and who these priests were.” The priests had
            shifted their spell from Kenrik to Verthandi by now.  He could feel
            the magical cords tightening around his body.
            </p>
            <p>
            “I know,” replied Kenrik. “He would have figured it out much
            earlier had I not weakened his judgement a little.” The ground
            began to crack. Fissures appeared around Verthandi.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Oh? How did you do that?” Verthandi asked. The fissures opened up,
            steam rising from the depths below.
            </p>
            <p>
            “A decade ago I sent him to find another druid. One that
            disappeared after meeting with the Hierophant. Of course I knew
            he’d never find him.”
            </p>
            <p>
            “I don’t remember meeting with a druid that disappeared.” A loud
            crack sounded, and the floor of the chamber began to fall away in
            pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
            “Of course not, you weren’t the Hierophant at the time.” Kenrik
            laughed. “You were the druid who disappeared.” Verthandi remembered
            now. That was the day he had eaten the brain of the previous
            Hierophant and taken his place. Beneath him, a portal was opening
            up.  He could see into its depths. The ground beneath his feet gave
            away and he plummeting downwards. The last thing he heard was
            Kenrik’s voice. “Goodbye Verthandi. It was good to see you one
            final time.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Kenrik left the ruins of the hospital on two normal feet.
            Apparently the curse had not survived Verthandi’s demise. The devil
            worshippers were surprisingly fair about the exchange.  They let
            him keep his life. They still had a claim on his soul, but he could
            surely work something out. Perhaps trade a few other souls for his.
            Kenrik shuddered. What was he thinking? He had to get back to the
            circle. He had to find more sacrifices for the devils below.  Young
            Tumeric would be perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
            Oh no, thought Kenrik. The new Hierophant, however, smiled.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Crokiak - The Shaper</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Dave Feldman</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/crokiak.png"></div>
            <p>
            Crokiak had always been fascinated with the workings of machines
            and gadgets. As a young Githzerai, he spent countless hours
            tinkering with clockwork devices and exploring the mysteries of
            magic. However, his fidgety nature and constant tinkering were not
            well-received by his monastic comrades. They viewed his
            preoccupation with machines as a distraction from their meditative
            practices and shunned him for his lack of focus.

            </p>
            <p>

            Despite their disdain, Crokiak persisted in his tinkering and
            eventually found a place of refuge in the monastery library. As the
            librarian, he spent his days surrounded by books, maps, and ancient
            tomes filled with the knowledge of generations of Githzerai
            scholars.
            </p>
            <p>


            After years of being shunned by his fellow Githzerai monks, Crokiak
            left the library and sought solace and purpose in the Plane of
            Mechanus, where he spent several years deepening his understanding
            of machines and constructs. The Modrons of Mechanus were initially
            skeptical of his tinkering, but they soon came to respect Crokiak's
            ingenuity and his unique perspective on the intricate workings of
            the multiverse.

            </p>
            <p>

            Under their tutelage, Crokiak delved deeper into the arcane
            mysteries of machines and constructs, studying ancient tomes and
            experimenting with new designs. He developed a particular
            fascination with the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, a massive
            machine that powered the entire plane and maintained its perfect
            order.  As he worked, Crokiak's mind became sharper and more
            focused than ever before. He developed an encyclopedic knowledge of
            mechanical devices and magical constructs, and he honed his skills
            in crafting intricate clockwork devices.

            </p>
            <p>

            After a harrowing experience working on a project in the Modron
            Catherdal in Regulus in which he barely escaped with his life,
            Crokiak returned to the monastery in Limbo to add his knowledge to
            library where he first discovered his love of machines.  One day,
            while lost in thought among the stacks of books, Crokiak overheard
            one of the head monks talking in hushed tones about a forbidden
            spell. The monk spoke of a powerful incantation that could
            resurrect the ancient dragon god Null and restore the glory of the
            Githzerai empire.

            </p>
            <p>

            Crokiak knew that such dark magic was strictly forbidden and could
            have catastrophic consequences. He resolved to confront the head
            monk and convince him to abandon his dangerous quest.  But before
            Crokiak could act, the head monk absconded with the forbidden tome,
            disappearing into the monastery's inner sanctum. Fearing the worst,
            Crokiak decided to follow him and retrieve the book before it was
            too late.

            </p>
            <p>

            As he crept through the darkened corridors of the inner sanctum,
            Crokiak heard the head monk chanting the forbidden spell. In a
            moment of panic, Crokiak stumbled into the room, unwittingly
            triggering the completion of the spell.  With a blinding flash of
            light, Crokiak was hurled through space and time, his body ripped
            apart by the raw power of the spell. When he awoke, he found
            himself in a place of torment and suffering, surrounded by demons
            and devils.

            </p>
            <p>

            Crokiak had unknowingly damned his soul to Hell, and there was no
            escape. Trapped in this infernal realm, Crokiak vowed to use his
            knowledge of machines and magic to find a way out and seek revenge
            against the monk that had betrayed Crokiak and his people

            </p>

            <p><strong>As played by Jason Pancoast</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/Feuriel.png"></div>
            <em>
                <p>
                She remembers nothing of her angelic existence, apart from the feeling of boundless joy and eternal peace in all things. And she remembers the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                The archangel Xandriel stood before her, surrounded by choirs and hosts of angels. He continued speaking,”...thou shalt hereafter be called Feuriel, and thou art hereby cast from Heaven---”
                </p>
                <p>
                At the instant the last syllable was uttered, the pain began, and it never stopped. Joy and peace were ripped from her, and physical pain accompanied it. She felt a vertigo, as if she was falling, though she could see nothing but blinding white light, which hurt also.
                </p>
                <p>
                She felt the pain of death, 666 times, as she passed through the mortal world repeatedly, still blinded but seeing only a dismal shade of gray. She felt again and again the futile agony of humanity. She remembers thinking, “So this is why they are as they are.”
                </p>
                <p>
                This was just the beginning of her journey, for the meaningless gray began to deepen into an ominous darkness. Deeper and deeper she fell, the trauma increasing. She felt her body burning, her wings being seared off, only to be reformed and destroyed again. Over and over, deeper and deeper, into the eternal suffering that is Hell.
                </p>
                <p>
                As an immortal being, she does not perceive time, so it can’t be said how long the fall lasted. But it had a beginning, and an end. The end, is in pure darkness, tangible evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                She can feel herself surrounded by beings of palpable hatred. Like a cornered animal, she brandishes her sword and presents her shield, which she still clutches, against the darkness. Terrified, but not afraid, Feuriel calls out to them, “Do unto me what you will! You cannot know the suffering I have already endured. Whatever you have for me, tis but a drop in the ocean, compared to what I have lost, where I have been. You will never know...”
                </p>
                <p>
                Her sight starts to return. She wishes it hadn’t.
                </p>
            </em>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Feuriel, or “Fury” as she can be called, is a being of contradictions. A stalwart of Heaven, conscripted to Hell, she is both beautiful and grotesque. Her pale flawless skin is in places split open, exposing blackened flesh and silvery bones. Her alluring shape is interrupted by gaping sinews where her form is not whole. One eye continuously weeps blood. Her long, unkempt, jet-black hair frames intoxicating, unwavering eyes which change color to match her mood. From her delicate shoulders sprout the useless remnants of mighty wings, charred and broken.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel’s demeanor is similarly contradictory. She is both confident and scared, powerful and frail. She distrusts everyone yet will ally with anyone. The only person she fully trusts is herself, and that is the person most likely to deceive her. She clings to a moral code, keeping her word above all else, and keeping her suffering within, except to inflict suffering on those who deserve it through their choices and actions. She believes she is superior to others, yet she feels inferior. She peers intently at a world she tries not to see, lost while knowing her place, in a realm completely foreign yet strangely familiar. Her self-control dances with anger; hope oscillates with despair. Her faith is being tested and she doesn’t know if she wants it to prevail or not.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel is a paladin of Torm, the lawful good God of duty, loyalty, and obedience. She still serves him, though she is unsure how. She wields an ornate longsword and a brilliant bronze shield whose insignia has been melted beyond recognition. Her lithe body is draped with scraps of white clothing and fragmented armor. She no longer has a halo.

            <h3 class="break">Aldoon of Gora - Nothing Special</h3>
            <p><strong>As played by Steve Graham</strong></p>
            <div class="portrait"><img class="portrait" src="img/aldoon.png"></div>
            <p>
            Aldoon of Gora was nothing special. The middle male child in a
            family of 9 children, he did not consider his life to have been
            easy despite the elevated position his house held in the Loxodon
            city of Erridon. He was not very smart, he was not exceptionally
            strong, he was not very brave, he was not exceptionally devout.
            Aldoon chose service with the order of The Sister, Iolensis,
            Loxodon goddess of the Seasons and Storms, mostly because it
            allowed him to serve away from the city and his family. Everyone in
            Clan Gora devoted their lives to the Gods - that was a foregone
            conclusion - but it was the mountain solitude that he really
            craved. He had never really felt the embrace of The Sister as his
            cohorts described.
            </p>
            <p>

            Never excelling in anything, and never seeming to completely devote
            himself to his patroness, he had disappointed his family
            continuously for 97 years. And now, in his early adulthood the only
            place he really felt at home was on the mountain trails high above
            the city, away from his family’s home. He knew this terrain like
            the tip of his trunk and he felt he knew his job here, if not his
            purpose.
            </p>
            <p>

            He was an acolyte of the order of Iolensis, charged with helping to
            maintain the shroud of secrecy over the valley. Erridon was an
            ancient city for the Loxodon people, and the mountains surrounding
            it held three holy sites, sacred not only to the Loxodon people.
            The mountains protected the valley, the city, and the holy sites
            alike, keeping at bay the lands of humans, elves, and the like.
            Sister of Seasons and Storms, Iolensis, lent her favor to her
            followers that they might help protect the valley with thick fog
            and violent storms in the high mountain passes.
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon knew the trails and passes, glades and meadows of these
            mountains, and was adept at creating the fog and some winds but did
            not know how to invoke the great storms his leaders (and some of
            his cohorts) could bring. He did not know if he ever would.
            </p>
            <p>

            In fact, on a brisk evening in the days teetering on the brink of
            winter, there were many things Aldoon of Gora did not know. He did
            not know that 8 days earlier, his father had died of unknown causes
            on the street while walking home from Council. He did not know that
            7 days prior his brother Colytus (his younger brother, and the
            youngest of the 9 siblings) had been sent into the mountains to
            retrieve him and bring him back for the funeral rites.
            </p>
            <p>

            Colytus had been sent to a camp Aldoon’s party had left a day
            before, and so missed him by half a day. He did not know of the
            missed connection or that Colytus, unaccustomed to the ancient,
            winding, crumbing pathways, had misstepped, and his brother and his
            2 companions had tumbled a thousand feet to their death.
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon did not know that on the morning of the previous day, with
            Colytus now 2 days overdue from his return, his eldest brother had
            taken ill with a mysterious malady. He wasted away quickly despite
            his great strength, and did not last past twilight. He did not know
            he was the last male of the great Gora clan.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Audorora, mage of The Sister, Primelepha, goddess of Knowledge,
            Law, and Magic, was going into the mountains to find her stupid
            brother. What had befallen her family in the last dayswas just too
            much. She needed to dry her eyes and get out. She needed to find
            Aldoon. She needed to find Colytus. She needed to get rid of the
            nagging, clutching feeling that something was desperately out of
            control and her family was in danger of being destroyed forever,
            and if she had just been paying attention, had <em>seen</em> it
            coming…
            </p>
            <p>

            She had been buried, completely isolated in her work for the last
            year, at least, having finally been brought into the inner conclave
            and finally given access to the ancient tomes, the knowledge of the
            true purpose of this valley. She hadn’t been paying attention to
            her family.
            </p>
            <p>

            And that last thing Aldoon said as he set back out to his mountain
            wanderings… What was it?
            </p>
            <p>

            She had said first… something like… “Glad you’re being useful.
            Helping the family.” She didn’t mean it to sound as sarcastic as it
            did. She tossed it over her shoulder as she was passing him, her
            arms full of books.
            </p>
            <p>

            And what did he say?
            </p>
            <p>

            “Yes. I’m sure when I return, I’ll have Father’s seat at council.”
            </p>
            <p>

            What did he mean by that? It was such an odd reply. She thought she
            knew what he was saying at the time. But now? Could he have done
            something? Made some deal? Set something in motion? He had never
            showed any desire to gain power or to be part of helping govern the
            city. But he could sometimes get so angry… Or was that just the
            tantrums of a child? How old was he the last time he really let her
            have it? She truly couldn’t remember.  Was he a threat?
            </p>
            <p>

            Did he know about the prophecy? She had brought her notes with her
            several times to the common areas. Had he seen? Did he have some
            secret ambition that would see opportunity in the coming lunar
            conjunction? Was he trying, in his stupid way, to become the focus
            of a misinterpreted prediction?
            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            The last prophecy of Antiquus of Endoon was taken down 327 years
            ago by no less than 6 Clerics, and none of the accounts matched. A
            large number of people had gathered for the vigil despite the
            terrifying countenance Antiquus held before finally speaking. When
            she finally spoke, it may have caught them off guard.
            </p>
            <p>

            Antiquus of Endoon was a respected oracle, having prophesied a
            horrendous plague when she was very young, and then aiding the
            Matriarchs of her day through several great calamities. She had The
            Sight, and was favored by Eritrea, the Allmother, it was sure.
            </p>
            <p>

            Near the end of her life, a servant found her one morning sitting
            bolt upright on the end of her bed, her fists white, clutching the
            bedclothes, her mouth open in a wide scream of abject terror, but
            making no sound. She stayed like that for 3 days and nights.
            </p>
            <p>

            Clerics and Mages gathered and tried to pull her out of her state,
            but to no avail. Shortly before dawn on the last night, she finally
            let loose her hoarse, agonized scream, letting her hands rize to
            her face to dig bright red scratches.
            </p>
            <p>

            Moments later she spoke. When she was finished, she would never
            speak again.
            </p>
            <p>

            Versions of the prophecy as taken down by the various clerics and
            mages present have been preserved and reproduced over the years.
            None are alike. But the account of Platann of Justa, when taken in
            context with several others, and when combined with his personal
            notes,seemed to be as close to the actual words of the oracle
            Antiquus. Or at least that is the conclusion Audorora came to as
            she studied the yellowing scrolls several months before the death
            of her and Aldoon’s father.
            </p>
            <p>
            As best as can be discerned this is what came out of the dry,
            cracked lips of Antiquus of Endoon:
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>
                When the three moons align,<br />
                as winter descends,<br />
                the last son of a great house<br />
                will be set on a path of dark transcendence.<br />
                His way will be opened by strangers to this land,<br />
                and family will bar his return.<br />
                But he will come home to Erridon,<br />
                And he will bring with him hell’s chosen,<br />
                And the city will tremble,<br />
                And he will be a destroyer of worlds.<br />
            </em>
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>

            The problem was, this account was not one that was widely
            circulated. Platann was terrified of this prediction, and kept it
            to himself for years, allowing other accounts of the prophecy to
            gain prominence. Nor did Audorora take reproductions of it out of
            the halls of the Conclave. The words burned in her mind, she needed
            only the contradictory, misinterpreted versions to study.
            </p>
            <p>

            In most accounts the last two lines are completely omitted.
            Antiquus’ voice must have been failing, the words becoming a mere
            whisper, or too gravelly to make out. The prophecy ends, in many
            reproductions, and in the ones Aldoon could have seen, with the
            mistakenly quoted 8th line as a variation of “and he will be the
            chosen one.” Like this, the prophecy becomes one of family
            infighting resulting in a male of great influence coming forth to
            rule.
            </p>
            <p>

            Some males speak of this prophecy as a time to come when a male
            will cause the Matriarch to step aside and will serve as a great
            Patriarch, and bring prosperity. One without knowledge of the true
            prophecy might even be tempted, if they were foolish enough, to try
            to make it come about.

            The winds grow cold, and the Three Moons approach conjunction for
            the first time in hundreds of years.

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Aldoon was startled at how quickly it all went bad. The Highmark’s
            sending had come as twilight fell, his words echoing slightly in
            Aldoon’s mind.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Four approach through Draydon’s Pass. Watch the Northwalk. Keep
            them from the Circle. Let The Sister be your strength.”
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon took his position overlooking the path carved into the
            cliff-face north of the Temple of the Circle. He watched as the
            storm clouds formed overhead, heard the booming thunder, and
            watched as fog filled the pass perhaps a half mile further north,
            conjured by theHighmark and his acolytes. All was as it had been
            dozens of times, as wayward travelers were discouraged from
            entering the valley. It usually worked.
            </p>
            <p>

            Aldoon watched in surprise as the thick fog was dissipated in an
            instant, the storm clouds swept away. He had time to notice how
            bright the night was. The moons were all out at once, all in a
            line. The land was bathed in moonlight.
            </p>
            <p>

            Then a battle erupted.
            </p>
            <p>

            He saw the Highmark’s lightning, called from the dissipating
            clouds, strike once, twice.  Heard a booming thunderclap, and the
            crack of sundered trees. And then an explosion of fire.  It was
            almost too bright to look at at first, and after, Aldoon saw to his
            dismay that the forest at the mouth of the pass was ablaze.
            </p>
            <p>

            Not knowing what else to do, he conjured his thick fog as far as he
            could along the cliff-face walkway, making it that much more
            treacherous. He loosed the trunk-sized logs, prepared for this
            purpose, to tumble down, further blocking the pathway. He readied
            another spell - and waited.
            </p>
            <p>

            Far too soon, he was caught off-guard by his fog cloud winking out
            of existence. He saw a blur of some sort on the pathway, and began
            to cast, intending to knock whoever approached into the chasm
            below.
            </p>
            <p>

            “I don’t think so.” He heard behind him, and felt a blade pierce
            his side.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Dammit!” the voice said as Aldoon’s tough hide turned the blade a
            bit more than his attacker anticipated. He turned, reaching for the
            warhammer he hated using. It should have been mere feet away
            leaning against a stone.
            </p>
            <p>

            Instead it came crashing down on his skull and his world went black.
            </p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Aldoon awoke slowly, realizing he was chained to the ground, his
            arms and legs spread wide. His side still felt on fire from the
            wound he’d suffered earlier, but it was not the only injury.  He
            had not been gently brought to this place.
            </p>
            <p>

            As he looked at the carved stone ceiling he realized he was in the
            Temple of the Circle.  And his limbs were chained to spikes newly
            pounded into the holy Circle that dominated the floor of the
            chamber.
            </p>
            <p>

            As he gathered his senses, he saw a robed human weaving magic that
            tore apart the tree-shaped stone altar at the head of the room to
            pluck the Emerald of Eritrea from the heart of the tree. He tossed
            the emerald aside. In its place, he enclosed the tree shaped
            stonework around a dark bloodstone - deep crimson with a golden
            swirl of something captured inside. The stonework darkened and
            drooped as though decaying.
            </p>
            <p>

            “You sure the Elephant guy’ll work?” someone said.
            </p>
            <p>

            “It must.” the robed man said.
            </p>
            <p>

            “He’s awake.” someone else said.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Take care of it.” the robed man said.
            </p>
            <p>

            Another sharp crack to Aldoon’s head and sparkles lit his vision.
            </p>
            <p>

            He did not know how much time passed, but he rose out of a daze to
            find the chains tightening. Braziers were lit all around him, and
            he realized someone was shouting. Chanting.
            </p>
            <p>

            The ground beneath him seemed to be glowing an awful reddish
            yellow. He felt the ground under him… thin somehow - become less
            tangible, though it still held him.
            </p>
            <p>

            The shouted chanting grew louder, more insistent. He felt what
            seemed like an enormous claw rake down his back, digging a furrow
            deep in his flesh, and then catch in chains that wrapped his torso.
            The the claw pulled. Adrenaline flooded Aldoon’s body as he felt
            himself being stretched, pulled, torn from the world.
            </p>
            <p>

            “Aldoon!” he heard from somewhere. And then the clash of fighting.
            An explosion. A flash of lightning. It was so near and also very
            far away. He fought against the chains, tried to will himself back
            into the world. His head turned slightly and he saw Audorora, his
            sister. What was she doing here?
            </p>
            <p>

            The robed human lay at her feet, perhaps dead. Another human still
            fought behind her with another Loxodon, an acolyte of the Highmark
            named Koroom. She held aloft a staff which blazed bright silvery
            light across the room and seemed to bend and dent the air around
            Aldoon somehow.
            </p>
            <p>

            A black chain shot out of the ground behind Aldoon and wrapped
            around the staff.  Another reached out to grab ahold of Audorora’s
            ankle. She screamed. She shouted something. The chains binding
            Aldoon gave a tremendous lurch and he was pulled downward, crushing
            him against the floor and digging with excruciating force on his
            limbs. Somehow it felt as though he would soon burst through the
            floor itself.
            </p>
            <p>

            A blast of silvery light and Audorora was free of the chains, but
            then a blackened, clawed hand reached forth from beside Aldoon’s
            head, reaching for her. Aldoon began to feel himself slide. He
            caught his sister’s gaze. She looked at him with sadness, pity,
            disgust. He thought again: “What is she doing here?”
            </p>
            <p>

            She turned, and with a word of power her staff blazed again. The
            altar shattered, and with it the bloodstone. Aldoon felt himself
            torn downward, the chains tightening even more, if that was even
            possible. He heard all around him and in his mind, an unfathomable
            booming voice: “I will take my payment!!”
            </p>
            <p>

            Darkness engulfed him, and there was pain, and he remained awake.
            </p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            Months. Years. Eons. Aldoon was dragged by his chains through
            uncountable planes for an unknowable period of time. Whatever had
            possession of him seemed to delight in dragging him, mile by mile,
            world by world, down through every possible horror to his final
            prison. No fire, no caustic slime, would melt the chains, no jagged
            stone could break them, no torment could kill him. He simply
            endured, his mind torn and twisting to somehow survive the endless
            implacable journey.
            </p>

            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>

            He did not know how long he had been still. He slowly realized,
            perhaps over the course of years, that the chains were gone. He was
            in darkness, laying on stone, but not one he recognized by mere
            feel. It was somehow too hard.
            </p>
            <p>

            Over time, he raised himself, felt his surroundings, found very
            little. Jagged too-hard stones surrounded him.
            </p>
            <p>

            In one small crack he found a charred bit of some unknown wood. He
            held this for some time. Perhaps a month.
            </p>
            <p>

            Slowly, he traced the wood with his fingers, bringing his mind back
            to himself. He began to shape it, carving off bits with his
            fingernails. He found he was making a symbol, one he had known some
            time ago. It was abstract. It could have been a wave or wind or a
            blown cloud. It had a streak through the center that was supposed
            to be lightning.
            </p>
            <p>
            After holding his symbol for a day, a week, a year, he finally
            spoke.  “Iolensis.” After a moment, the symbol began to glow.
            </p>

            <strong><em>as observed by Verthandi</em></strong>
            <p>
            Verthandi awoke to screaming. It sank into him slowly. Only a few
            voices at first, and then more and more. They varied as well. One
            sounded like the gears of a broken water wheel. Another like a
            disused bugle. He couldn’t see. Some kind of mucus covered his
            eyes.  He also realized he was screaming, although silently into
            the minds of those around him using his telepathy.
            </p>
            <div class="illustration_wide"><img class="illustration_wide" src="img/tunnel_mask.png"></div>
            <p>

            Attempting to bring his own terror under control, he thought back
            to the last moments he could remember. It was like waking up from a
            dream. But it wasn’t just his capture and damnation that started to
            slip away from his memory, but his entire life seemed to receding
            into a haze. Even his name, or rather the name of the previous
            Hierophant that he had supplanted and assumed, barely remained.

            </p>
            <p>
            The screaming had begun to subside. Verthandi also had ceased his
            quiet exclamations, and began to take in his situation. He felt
            weak, both mentally and physically.  And he was physically bound by
            some viscous rope-like that held his arms against his body and
            prevented his legs from moving. Struggling only slid him around
            inside the bindings, slacking them not at all.

            </p>
            <p>
            He used his tentacles to wipe away some of the thick fluid from his
            eyes and took in his situation. He was in long room, fastened to
            one fleshy wall with what appeared to be bloody sinew. On one end
            was a portal that looked like a sphincter, and along with the walls
            gave Verthandi the impression they must have been in the rectum of
            some kind of giant or colossus.  As his vision cleared, he saw
            there were others in the room, unsurprising as the other screams
            had to be coming from somewhere.

            </p>
            <p>
            Across from him, also tied to the living wall, was a creature
            seemingly made of both man and machine, but in a haphazard manner
            with no rhyme or reason for which pieces of flesh were replaced
            with metal, or had he been a mechanical man with flesh inserted?
            Was there a living brain inside that head? Verthandi did not want
            to find out.

            </p>
            <p>
            Glancing up the room towards the disgusting knot of an exit at the
            end, he took in the rest of their motley crew. There was a loxodon
            with its great elephant’s head and trunk.  Verthandi had tried to
            eat a few loxodon’s brains before, but he could never finish the
            meal, and he always felt stuffed afterwards. Too many unforgotten
            memories, he assumed. He wondered if this loxodon’s memory was
            becoming as spotty as his own. Still, he noticed he was hungry. The
            cultists’ brains he had eaten before had not been satiating. The
            minds of fanatics never were.

            </p>
            <p>
            Next was an angel, or maybe better to say what was left of an
            angel. Verthandi had never been to the plane they resided, but this
            one definitely looked worse for wear. She was gaunt and with wounds
            covering her body, and her wings looked as if they had been torn
            from her body. Blood streaked her face, and seemed to be leaking
            from her eyes. She seemed to shrinking into herself, an oddity for
            angel. Verthandi had never eaten a celestial brain, but others had
            told him they tasted bland.

            </p>
            <p>
            After her was a rabbit, or rather one of the bunny-kin. Many of his
            former circle liked to turn into rabbits. Their brains were tasty,
            although the portions were too small for his liking.  This one was
            the size of a human though. He was clearly attempting to slip his
            bonds, but like the rest of them, to no avail. Still, the furry
            creature did appear to be getting further than any of the rest of
            them did.

            </p>
            <p>
            And across from the bunny was a gith. Covered almost completely,
            others might not immediately recognize one of them, but Verthandi
            had seen enough gith slaves to know. This one, however, did not
            appear to have the same emaciated pallor that most had, and his
            clothing was made from bits of machinery and other items. He seemed
            to be staring most intently at the mechanical man.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            At the end of the hall, if one could call it a hall, were two more
            that Verthandi couldn’t really make one. One appeared to be a
            knight of some kind, perhaps even a paladin based on the heraldry
            that covered his armor. The other had the dark look of a drow elf,
            although he seemed to flicker in and out of existence. Staring too
            long at him gave Verthandi a headache.

            </p>
            <p>
            By now some of the group had begun to speak to one another, while
            Verthandi checked over his equipment as best he could while still
            bound. He still had his legendary rainbow flail, although his
            attempt to telepathically link to it failed. Its multicolored hues
            seemed faded and mottled, as if it had been subjected to acid. It
            felt dead to him. His rainbow shield was pitted and chipped,
            although still brighter than the flail, and his leather armor was
            torn, the rainbow patterns becoming streamers that hung limply from
            his body.

            </p>
            <p>
            Finally a voice boomed out from beyond the portal, which was now
            opening, saying “Come forth and present yourselves to me!” The
            bonds loosened and fell away. Verthandi and the others were free,
            and looked at one another, wondering what to do next before finally
            decided to go into the next room to see what was in store for them
            in this strange place.

            </p>
            <p>
            The room they entered into was huge, with a circular platform
            surrounded by what looked like lava. Small ramps led into doors to
            the left and across from where they entered, and standing at the
            door to the left was and old human wearing red priestly-looking
            garb, although Verthandi had his doubts about the godliness of the
            person. Not in this place. Which made him wonder, where were they?
            He felt like he should know, but like so much of his knowledge, it
            seemed to be just beyond his ability to remember.  He glanced at
            the angel, seeing recognization in her face, but before he was able
            to ask her where they were, the man spoke.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Welcome. I don’t think we’re ever had such a diverse group
            before,” said the man.
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/enkosee.png"></div>
            “I am Enkosee. Some of you may have already realized, but you’re in
            hell.” Memories of his last moments flooded back to him. Those
            devil worshippers had somehow managed it. They hadn’t just opened a
            portal and pushed him through. They had damned him. Even if he had
            been able to leave this place, he probably would still be
            intrinsically tied here.  Enkosee went on to explain that they were
            the lucky ones. They weren’t going to be tortured and subjected to
            their worst fears for eternity, but rather, if they so chose, they
            were going to work for the devils doing their bidding, for all
            eternity. It sounded better, but only barely.

            </p>
            <p>
            The paladin, for that’s what he had to be, was having none of this.
            He immediately drew his weapon and attempted to charge the devil’s
            minion, or perhaps he was a devil himself, Verthandi thought. Two
            steps into his charge however, and the paladin was lifted into the
            air. His eyes bulged and his body stiffened, and then exploded into
            pieces. Weirdly enough the various pieces were whole. Verthandi
            could see each organ: heart, lungs, eyeballs, and so on, still in
            one piece. And still alive as well. And out from his skull came his
            brain, which only made Verthandi hungrier. He suspected that if he
            attempted to eat any of the group, he would end up just like the
            paladin, so he quickly suppressed that thought. Then the former
            paladin was unceremoniously dumped into the lava, which upon closer
            inspection turned out not to be lava, but rather a sea of flesh.
            Pieces of beings writhing in pain and supplying some kind of energy
            to the masters of this plane. Verthandi shuddered. Very little
            bothered him, but somehow he had to make sure he did not become
            part of their power source.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            The elephant-headed man started to ask Enkosee a question. A
            loxodon, Verthandi had to struggle to remind himself. Was his
            memory fading still? The loxodon wanted a copy of the rules they
            had to follow. Enkosee thought this was a great idea, and directed
            them to find the Scribery. Pointing them towards the doorway that
            was on the opposite side of the orifice they had emerged from, he
            told them finding these rules would be their first task, and that
            they should find someone by the name of Panulis.

            </p>
            <p>
            Since it appeared they would be stuck together for a while,
            Verthandi introduced himself. The angel went by the name of
            Feuriel. Bandito was the bunny-kin. The gith called himself
            Crokiak, and the loxodon was Aldoon. The man-machine could not seem
            to remember his name, although Crokiak seemed to believe he could
            fix that. The drow did not speak.

            </p>
            <p>
            A strange feeling overcame Verthandi. It was like he was heading
            out for the first time time with a group of like-minded individuals
            on an adventure as he had shortly after joining the druidic circle
            so many years ago. Although whether it was his memory or the
            memories of his companions who’s brains he had eaten on that first
            trip, the circle was not happy when they found out he was the only
            survivor of a kobold attack, Verthandi did not know. Either way,
            there was a refreshing upbeat feeling among the group, which lasted
            as long as it took for them to get through the door and into an
            unending corridor that ran off to the left and right of the door
            for as far as they could. Hundreds, if not thousands of creatures
            walked along it’s reddish brick, which had been worn smooth over
            the millennia. There were devils, imps, and other hellish creatures
            traveling this enclosed road, and a variety of other doors and
            buildings were along it. He still felt they were out of place.

            </p>
            <p>
            Some of the group started heading off to the left, but not wanting
            to wander this land for eternity, Verthandi went back to his
            original method that he used to get into the druidic circle. He
            grabbed a random devil, and sending his magical energy though the
            brightly, abet faded, painted druidic focus, which was a unicorn
            riding a rainbow, charmed the devil.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Tell me where the scribery is,” he demanded.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Oh, it’s you Bob.” The devil seemed to recognized Verthandi.
            Victims of the charming spell always seemed to think he was someone
            he wasn’t. “Good to see you again! The scribery? Why would you want
            to go there?”

            </p>
            <p>
            “We need to find it.”

            </p>
            <p>
            “Well you’re going in the wrong direction. It’s about five hours
            travel that way,” he said, pointing back down the corridor. “I
            could take you there. We could catch up. It’s been a few centuries
            since we say each other.”

            </p>
            <p>
            Verthandi didn’t want to be around when the spell wore off. Humans
            were touchy enough about having magic used upon their minds. He
            didn’t think devils would be any less irksome about it. “No, I’ll
            get in touch with you later. Thank for you the help.”

            </p>
            <p>
            And so the group turned around, and started to walk. Silence
            permeated their travel, apart from an occasional comment or
            muttered remark. None of them had a way to tell how long they had
            been walking for, except for maybe the mechanically-inclined
            Crokiak or the mechanically-included...whatever his name used to
            be. Verthandi again wondered if there was a brain inside that
            skull, and whether he could figure out his name if he consumed it.
            After what could have been five hours, or five hundred, they
            arrived outside the Scribery. Two hellish looking guards stood
            blocking the entrance. Verthandi thought about using another spell
            to charm one of the guards, but he only had one left and there were
            two of them.

            </p>
            <p>
            “We have been sent by Enkosee to find Panulis,” said Feuriel. “Let
            us pass.”

            </p>
            <p>
            “Piss off,” was the response given by one of the guards, who kept
            eyeing a stash of loot that sat nearby.

            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/lesser_bearded_devils.png"></div>
            <p>
            “They must want a bribe,” said Aldoon. “But where are we going to
            find something to give them?” The rabbit-eared Bandito smiled and
            said, “I’ll just grab something from their own pile.” He and
            Crokiak began to confer, speaking of the best way to distract the
            two guards and grab what they needed, but it seemed impossible even
            for the two together. Verthandi suspected they were suffering from
            he same diminished capability he was.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            Feuriel finally seem to grow tired of waiting and drew up to her
            full height and demanded that the guards allow them to enter,
            towering over them even though she was physically shorter.
            Verthandi thought he could see her angelic wings for a second, but
            then they were gone again. Unfortunately, devils, even their
            guards, aren’t too impressed by celestial posturing. But then the
            metallic man pulled one of the guards aside and spoke to him in
            even more threatening tones. Whatever he did, it worked as one of
            the guards seemed to crumple against the other, and they began to
            speak in low tones. Finally they capitulated and let the group into
            the Scribery. Verthandi was thankful that they didn’t have to fight
            the guards, as he still wasn’t sure if that would be considered
            against the rules and get them all killed.

            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/scribery.png"></div>
            <p>
            The inside of the Scribery was gigantic. Rows of tables and shelf
            after shelf of bookcases lined the room. Sitting at the tables were
            hundreds of small creatures. They looked like gnomes, but twisted.
            All of them were writing furiously on pieces of parchment.
            Verthandi sighed. Clearly Enkosee was testing them, but they didn’t
            have much choice in the matter. At least not yet. He walked over to
            a surprisingly comfy chair, picked up a throw pillow that had all
            the stuffing bunched up in one end and sat down. The others started
            questioning some of the gnomes while Feuriel and the mechanical man
            started looking at the bookshelves.  One of these creatures had to
            at least know where Panulis was, thought Verthandi. And so one by
            one he started touching each mind sending the name “Panulis” to
            each. By luck, one of the gnomes who’s skin looked a bit more
            reddish than the others looked up and said

            </p>
            <p>
            “Who is calling me?”

            </p>
            <div class="illustration"><img class="illustration" src="img/failed_imp.png"></div>
            <p>
            Aldoon walked over to Panulis and said, “We were sent by Enkosee
            for the rules of hell.” Panulis responded with “Of course, I’ll get
            you a copy,” but made no effort or attempt to stop his scribbling.
            When it became obvious that no progress was going to be made,
            Aldoon and Bandito pulled the paper out from under his pen. Then
            from above came an imp, and started scratching at Panulis, no doubt
            because he had stopped his incessant writing. Looking up, Verthandi
            saw there were many of the imps in the rafters above. They must be
            there to make sure the gnomes continuing their seemingly pointless
            work.

            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel, again tiring of the delay, then pulled out a javelin and
            threw it straight through the imp’s shoulder, and things started to
            get more interesting.
            </p>

            <h3 class="break">Week 2</h3>
            <strong><em>as observed by Bandito</em></strong>
            <p>
            <em>But surely she would have known this would happen if she
                attacked them...how could she not?!  She must be very powerful
                to have had that kind of bravery. Or perhaps very stupid. But
                she’s an Angel ... sort of ... well, I can’t let her die,
                Enkosee seemed to think we were all important in some
                way...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>*thwip* *SPLUT*</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito loosed his crossbow and the bolt was perfectly true, his
            indecision turned to decision to join the fray defending the fallen
            angel. The bolt pierced straight through the back of the imp’s
            neck, and out his mouth. YESSS! The body of the small imp exploded
            in grotesque and poisonous gas and green intestines, splattering
            again all over Feuriel. NOOOO!  Bandito’s inner monologue
            confounded by the great shot followed by further misery the poor
            Feuriel encountered after this ugly creature’s death!
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>I wonder if I can hide under the table from that, that looks
                disgusting!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            After his bolt killed that imp, Bandito sees one flee. Bandito
            smiles, and giggles ... he always did enjoy when his precision and
            surprise attacks had the consequential benefit of fear against
            those who were fighting against him. But then a stone flies in
            front of Bandito, striking the fleeing imp, and it explodes
            violently. Bandito flinches, but thankful another one of those
            beasts are dead.

            </p>
            <p>
            <em>What’s with all those moving books?! Looks like some are on the
                ground and some are going back up on the shelves?! What
                the...</em>Bandito observes the unseen servant’s behaviors and
            the seemingly confusing actions of the man-machine, but then sees
            him point and say “NNOOO” and some strange light shoots out of his
            finger and hits an imp, who is clearly both surprised and
            infuriated.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>What is Aldoon chanting or praying about? I mean he’s slow and
                in a moment of action, just standing there praying?! ... I
                can’t believe Enkosee picked this priest to help... I was
                hoping he’d be more help... I need to find some cover and hide
                before things get ugly!</em>
            Bandito dips in underneath the table, disappearing from anyone’s
            sight....JUST in time to see another bolt of energy flash above the
            table, and oh no! The splash of the imp guts all over the floor and
            back up into his face! <em>Oh no, this is horrible!? How did Feuriel
                get hit with this so many times!?  BLEAAUUUAHHHH! Good gawd, I
                can’t stopppp! What’s going on up thhhh...heeuaahhhh!!!</em>
            Bandito vomits violently from the consequential splash as the imp
            explodes his poisonous insides all over the floor and the splash
            consequently on Bandito. Obviously Feuriel takes the brunt of the
            splash, though she’s already covered and heaving, but even Bandito
            gets violently sick with this one.
            </p>
            <p>
            As the feeling begins to subside, he hears some cheers and
            conversation from above the table, but his head is still
            pounding... the taste of vomit fresh in his mouth, he really has no
            idea what’s going on up there.... Bandito pulls out his waterskin
            from his pack. Taking a big mouthful of water, swishing it all
            around his mouth and spitting it in on the floor, then a second big
            gulp and swallowing this one. <em>Feuriel must feel horrible if this is
            how I feel! I should give her some water, I’m sure she could use
            that...</em>Bandito creeps out from under the table, looking around, and
            sees the imps nowhere to be seen, there seems to be some focus
            around Panulis, who seems to have taken something out and given it
            to Crokiak...”Feuriel, my dear, you probably want some of this..”
            and Bandito extends his waterskin to the struggling Feuriel. She
            seems interested in the exchange going on above the table, but
            she’s still on her knees, working to get up.

            </p>
            <p>
            “Yes, thank you, little one” she says.

            </p>
            <hr class="journal" />
            <p>
            <em>So this is the famous book of rules - doesn’t seem to impressive to
                me...</em>Bandito grasps what the conversation is all about - a book
            that seems to bite back given the bloody fingers several
            surrounding the book have gotten.  <em>Well, that seems certainly
            appropriate, the law book is painful to read ...  seems like every
            stinking law I’ve learned of. Never given me anything of value -
            just nothing but pain - just like the rest of this godforsaken
            place....</em>Bandito’s mind pauses, his eyes go to the fallen angel ...
        his lips curl in a smirk. <em>Well.... I suppose it is ...
            god...forsaken... I wonder what she did to get here ... seems like
            it couldn’t be good... I’ll need to remember not to cross her, stay
            on her good side....glad I offered her some water after all.</em>
            Bandito’s perspective on Feuriel shifts from feeling sorry for her
            to feeling lucky he’s begun to be on her good side.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Are they seriously going to read this whole stupid book here?! We
            need to get out of here...  those imps are coming back with
            reinforcements!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito steps up to the table, and clears his throat to try and get
            the big people’s attention.  *AHEM* “I don’t know what you all are
            planning, but we should be leaving this place...there are always
            consequences...” he says, his voice trailing off ... as he
            suspiciously looks around as the final book goes back on the shelf,
            and a broom, mop, and bucket begin moving around the room cleaning
            up the remains of the imps... <em>well I haven’t seen this before, but
            I suppose this is a good idea - getting the remains of those awful
            things gone is really important for us to get out of here
            unscathed.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Paulis responds to Bandito, “Yes, right! Well there are two options
            to getting to Uman Yango now that you have the book of rules - the
            long way or the *ahem* short cut, which, well ... isn’t entirely
            allowed for me to bring you that way, but you seem like proper
            folks who could use a little rest and as long as you don’t tell
            Enkosee, we could go that way...”
            </p>
            <p>

            Bandito quickly responds, excited about the prospect of a short cut
            after this debacle... “That would be wonderful - do tell where do
            we ... “
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito is interrupted by Crokiak and then Feuriel “We should
            really take the appropriate way, and not try and take short cuts or
            break the rules” Aldoon saying “I’m good for a walk....” and
            everyone overruling Bandito without a second thought, he rolls his
            eyes and looks frustratingly at Panulis, who also seems a bit
            disappointed, looking around and gathering a few items. <em>Isn’t this
            just like the tall people...always not even taking us smaller ones
            into account. Like who put them in charge?! Such rule followers ...
            which, honestly ... could they even find the stupid rule that says
            that we can’t take the short cut ... the dumb rules are irrelevant
            as long as we don’t get caught ... and CLEARLY Panulis knows how to
            not get caught... but nope ... they don’t want to listen to him
            either ... whatever ... they’re big. I was outnumbered ... time to
            learn more about this place from Panulis, I’ve now got time for
            that...</em>He rolls his eyes, and heads out, trying to help Panulis
            through the traffic in the streets, but he clearly knows his way
            along...telling Bandito “Yes, yes, I know, I know ... no need to
            point that out to me- I know where I’m going and how to get through
            all this..”
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito looks back at the others, and sees several of them huddled
            around the book, which is floating along in front of them while
            they walk. <em>What a spectacle - always the tall people TRYING to draw
                attention to themselves.</em> He rolls his eyes. Curiously, no one seems
            to be stopping them, though there are a lot of strange stares...
            but there’s no interjecting. One devil talking to another devil,
            pointing it out, but then turning away and minding their own
            business once they see it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>They look so ridiculous, fretting over the rules of this place. I
            just need to get close to Enkosee, he’s my “get out of jail free”
            card - I mean it never matters what the rules are, tall people
            always change them anyhow...but once I have earned value by the
            boss - that’s my opportunity! I hope I get to prove myself here...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Little did he know that was just what was in store for him...
            </p>
            <p>
            The conversation with Panulis was scintillating, and it surely
            seems to be exactly as he expected it would be - they talk a lot
            about “rules”, and how much they’re talked about here, and SEEM
            important, but the random assortment of rules are always used to
            the advantage of the bosses and if they don’t have a rule that
            suits them, they just make another one. The more he learned about
            it, Hell was just like Xanathar’s gang ... the strong survive. They
            always do.  Once again, Bandito curses the weak body he was born to
            ... frail and weak. But he’s been successful so far using his
            quickness and his wit - hoping that will work here too. <em>So right
            now - Enkosee’s the strongest I’ve seen down here ... lets see what
            we can do to find a way to show him value...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            They seem to slow down, and appear into another large stone door,
            and Panulis indicates we are here, telling them all to be on their
            best behavior.
            </p>
            <p>

            They walk into a massive cavern, and there’s ... <em>What the HELL is
                that thing!? </em>Bandito stops dead in his tracks. Bandito sees a large
            devil with red wings and body that he’s never seen anything like,
            but curiously it is not taking any actions toward them. Its then
            that he spots several others in the room, including Enkosee. There
            seems to be some kind of ritual circle, and Enkosee is barking out
            orders to others in robes. <em>There he is, we will finally get to
                prove our value.</em>
            </p>
            <p>

            As the group approaches Enkosee, he’s pleased to see them, and
            welcomes them. Bandito’s demeanor immediately brightens when he
            mentions Waterdeep. <em>This is great - I know RIGHT where Jarnsen’s is
            - that old man gave me bit of bread and kept me alive some days
            when I was a wee kitten - lost in a world of tall people, and
            trying to find my way. Just any piece of kindness was welcomed by
            Bandito in those days as the daylight in his dreary night of
            existence.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Enkosee completes his description of the “job” they have,
            describing Jarnsen, handing the scrolls to the broken man-machine
            that they are expected to convince the old man Jarnsen to sign the
            contract of his own volition, and then they would teleport back.
            Sounds simple enough.  Bandito smiled at the way Enkosee described
            a man of “irrelevance” they would encounter when they went through
            the portal... <em>surely if Enkosee thinks of some tall people as
            inconsequential, and is giving me this task, he must think highly
            of me - this is great!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            And as the massive beast holds open the portal apparently
            struggling to not go through himself, and the men in robes
            commanded by Enkosee all chant in unison, Enkosee calmly tells us
            to go on through the portal and prove ourselves of value to him.
            Bandito leaps through first, ready to do just that...
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito sees Manfred, the “inconsequential” wizard described by
            Enkosee’s eyes widen as he comes through the portal - clearly not
            what he had expected, and then as the remainder of our motley crew
            passes through, and the portal closes, waves of confusion and fear
            as he re-reads his scrolls and re-mouths the words he was saying.
            “Who are you, I don’t understand” he says...really to no one in
            particular.
            </p>
            <p>
            As Verdandi exits the circle we originated in and heads for the
            door, Bandito moves forward to district and help to confuse the
            Wizard, approaching him, and wandering around him, asking him
            questions, and telling him wild stories about where he’s just been,
            but in such ways that the Wizard is not so much intrigued as
            confused and uncertain of his own abilities any longer.  Meanwhile,
            Bandito does as he’s done for years, and easily swipes some keys, a
            gem, and gold from the wizards’ robes. <em>Well that was easier than I
                thought... </em>he chuckles to himself and walks toward and out the
            door, thanking Manfred for his hospitality, and hoping him great
            success.

            </p>
            <p>
            As they exit that room, they are in a hallway, and Bandito quickly
            realizes by looking through the windows that its not quite dark
            enough to bring this band of freaks straight through Waterdeep. <em>I
            mean, Waterdeep has plenty of weirdo’s - but this particular group
            will stand out far too much, never mind a mind flayer walking
            straight through town would most CERTAINLY bring in the guard. I
            mean maybe with one or two of these odd character’s we could grease
            certain guards to look the other way, but there’s really no chance
            of anything good happening with us roaming straight through the
            city, so I’ll need to help them get better disguised and we need to
            wait a bit to do this under the cover of darkness. There’s a great
            many eyes and ears in Waterdeep...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            So Bandito leads the group out the back door to Manfred’s lovely
            home. He finds what appears to be a shed or garage of some kind,
            and encourages everyone to get inside and get disguised, as he puts
            on his own hat, bringing his ears back to be a bit more subtle as
            he always did.  There were many questions about why they would need
            to be disguised, and why they should listen to the rabbit, at which
            point he emphatically says, “This is where I’m from - I KNOW this
            place! I know it WELL. Trust me. We don’t want to just walk through
            the streets, people will call the guard, and it will be far more
            complicated than need be.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel chimes in, “Wait, you’re ACTUALLY FROM here?!”
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito, with a deadpan look on his face, “yes, that’s what I said.
            Now lets get changed!”
            </p>
            <p>
            And the group demeanor seemed to shift ever so slightly. <em>Maybe they
            could listen to us small people. Time will tell - but at least
            they’re listening...for now...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            He spent extra time helping the Mind flayer disguise himself, and
            thankfully his outfit looked proper. Everyone had some version of
            disguise, which should help as we navigate through the streets.
            </p>
            <p>
            As night fell, and the party completed their disguises, Bandito
            walks the streets nearby, checking that the coast is clear, and
            they can depart. He returns to the room where the party is, and
            says “Are we ready - the coast is clear to exit...follow me
            carefully, and we should be able to get there without too much
            trouble along the way...” and the group files out of garage, headed
            down a dark alley after the rabbit man. As they dip in and out of
            dark alleys, Bandito tracking them through less populated parts of
            the city. It was not exactly a direct route, but he knew these
            streets, and needed to take the less populated routes - not
            everyone was disguised perfectly ...  and he didn't want to get
            caught.
            </p>
            <p>
            As they were transitioning from one dark alley to another, he knew
            they had to go by a popular bar, but hoped that they would pass
            uneventfully, but Crokiak was spotted... as Bandito turned to look
            that everyone made it from the next alleyway, he sees a small group
            of revelers that piled out of the bar talking with Crokiak. <em>Oh boy,
                this can’t be good.</em> Bandito says to himself, but almost as soon as
            the conversation began with Crokiak, the conversation was over, and
            they were moving on. Somehow, Crokiak may have had some kind of
            power over the drunks to

            leave them alone - they initially seemed like they were going to be
            trouble, but off they went, happy as ever!
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito knew they were almost there, and he led the group through
            nearly the final alleyway, but then someone tripped over the
            homeless man who was sleeping in the alley. He complained, but then
            rolled over in his box, and went back to sleep, thankfully. Darting
            a look at the remainder of the group, he said “We’re almost there,
            don’t screw it up now!” and off he went...
            </p>
            <p>
            They initially approached Jarnsen’s from across the street. Bandito
            turns to the others and says, “there’s a rear entrance, if I
            remember, and since its closed, I can go investigate things more
            closely while you all gather across the street behind the store.
            Meet you there in a few minutes!” And away he slips into the
            darkness. He spends time “casing the job” and sees old man Jarnsen
            inside reading a scroll. He notices the window and door entrances,
            observing one of the entrances seems to require you to walk across
            what may be a creaky set of steps, while the other one has stone
            steps, so as he’s formulating a plan to entry and engagement, he
            sees Crokiak boldly just walking up to the creaky steps, and
            banging on the door. <em>What the...I thought we were going to come up
            with a plan!? Well, I guess not ... these guys just strolling right
            up there... *hrumph* ugh, tall people.</em> Bandito rolls his eyes
            again, and slips in the back entrance silently while the rest go in
            through the other entrance. Curiously and a bit unexpectedly, the
            old man welcomes the strange group into his shop. He observes
            Crokiak and the broken man-machine’s engagement with Jarnsen, “We.
            HAVE. What...you’re...looking for...you just... need to ... sign
            this” as the broken man breaks the scroll seal and unfurls and
            hands the contract to Jarnsen.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feuriel says, her arms folded, “I wouldn’t sign that if I were
            you.” Jarnsen raises his eyebrow, and as the Broken Man reaffirms
            his statement, Jarnsen raises his glass and focuses in on the paper
            put in front of him.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Mind Flayer quietly saunters to the door to the main store,
            seemingly checking to make sure no one else is here. <em>I sure hope
                he’s not planning to eat this Jarnsen’s brain...</em> Bandito watches
            Verdandi cautiously, hopeful that wasn’t his plan, but honestly,
            not sure what he’d do about it if it were ... he remains unsettled
            by the Mind Flayer ... but so far, he’s been largely supportive of
            our group’s success - so he wonders whether he’ll ever get
            comfortable with Verdandi...
            </p>
            <p>
            Bandito’s attention shifts back to the center of the room.
            Crokiak’s eyes seem to be darting around the room at all the books,
            and begins to focus in on the scroll Jarnsen was reading when they
            arrived. “What’s that” he asks Jarnsen, as he’s beginning to read
            the contract and pointing at the scroll left on the table he was
            sitting at.
            </p>
            <p>
            Leaving the contract he was reading, Jarnsen quickly engages the
            Githzerai excitedly, “Oh that, its a new piece I just received in,
            and was trying to understand it - it seems like some kind of
            instruction, but I can’t read any of it beyond the pictures...”
            </p>
            <p>

            “Oh, that? Its Modron - I know that and could help you translate it
            once you sign the contract.”, Crokiak volunteers. Jarnsen looks
            back at the contract warily. At this point, Bandito takes the
            opportunity to lean in, using his most peaceful demeanor, those
            rosy pink bunny eyes, and his wriggling nose, looking up at
            Jarnsen, and says, “Yes, I remember when I was a wee kitten, you
            used to offer me scraps of bread and food from your shop when I was
            the most desperate. If you were able to help me when I was in such
            need, I’m sure we can help you - we just need you to sign the
            contract so we can work together to help each other...” Jarnsen
            looks at the harengon, pats him on the head, and his kind eyes look
            back at the contract scroll, pick up the quill, and he says, “well,
            I haven’t gotten all the way through it, but if someone has sent
            you to help me, and this is the way to it, then I’m certain signing
            this will be the best course of action...” and signs the contract.
            </p>
            <p>
            Jarnsen then puts down his glass, and turns his attention to
            Crokiak, “Interesting, I was just saying to myself, ‘God, I wish
            someone would come help me figure out what in the world this said’”
            The looks between the party members, especially Feuriel are telling
            to Bandito - but luckily Jarnsen seems enthralled suddenly in the
            idea that Crokiak was purposely sent here to help him with the
            translation...he also sees Crokiak begin to scrutinize the back of
            the scroll and then the broken man joins in the curiosity, and
            begins even writing down what he’s seeing on the scroll. Jarnsen is
            suddenly alarmed, “Oh no, you cannot copy that here, that’s not
            allowed in my shop at all!” Crokiak then says, “Fine, how much
            would you sell this for.” As he looks up from his writing, sliding
            the page over to The Broken Man to continue the work, while he
            engaged with Jarnsen.
            </p>
            <p>
            Jarnsen pulls on his beard a bit, looking up at the ceiling,
            clearly a bit uncertain, but senses the opportunity. “Well, I’m not
            sure - I’ve just now gotten it, but it appears to be valuable
            instructions to something powerful. Without really knowing, I’d
            happily sell this to you for 500 gold.” Crokiak chuckles under his
            breath, and before he can respond, Bandito, sensing the moment,
            intercedes, and diverts Jarnsen’s attention, excitedly saying,
            “Wow, pages like that can go for that much money!? I can’t even
            imagine that?! So incredible! Tell me more!”
            </p>
            <p>
            Jarnsen, with the small Harengon’s sudden excited interest, tells
            him, “Why yes, its quite a business - we have a great many valuable
            tomes and archives!” At this point, Bandito begins pointing out
            different seemingly important books to try and get him engaged in
            each tome, telling him about them and their value, hopefully giving
            time to Crokiak and the Broken Man to copy down whatever they
            needed to without Jarnsen’s wary eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
            As he’s listening idly to Jarnsen praddle on about some ancient
            tome, he sees Feuriel’s impatient side again, and she storms over
            to Crokiak, and he vaguely hears her demand “Are we really going to
            fool around with those old man, we’ve already damned him to a
            lifetime of eternal damnation, we should just take the thing and be
            done with this, lets get on with it!” Bandito’s eyes quickly flit
            back to Jarnsen, worried he had heard this damning statement, and
            wondered if there would be trouble. Thankfully - Jarnsen was deep
            in a dusty old tome, and Bandito feigned interest as the old man
            looked up at him just as he was telling him about the value of the
            book. <em>I think its about the leave this place before we wind up
            having more trouble
            than I can get us out of...</em> And Bandito sees The Broken Man, just
            finishing up his drawing, Crokiak goes to take the original
            article, and the Broken Man reaches his hand out, looking sternly
            at the Githzerai, and tells him “No, we have our copy, this one is
            his....” Bandito keeps Jarnsen engaged by pointing something out in
            the book, hoping like crazy that this doesn’t blow up...
            </p>
            <p>
            Crokiak stares directly into the glowing eyes of The Broken Man,
            and it seems like minutes to Bandito, as he watches the exchange
            over the old man’s shoulder ... <em>Please, PLEASE don’t make a scene
            right now - we’re almost done with this quest! Enkosee will see our
            value if you don’t screw this up!</em> And after Crokiak’s eyes go from
